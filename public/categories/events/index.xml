&lt;p>In the space of just five lessons, starting on the first of July, &lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/author/adrian-liberto/">Adrian Liberto&lt;/a>, author, journalist, a former professor at the American University of Rome and current editor-in-chief of the Gordian Magazine, will teach you how to overcome your weaknesses in writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Adrian will use his vast reserves of experience and enthusiasm to give you an overall assessment of your writing strengths and weaknesses and how to maximise the former and overcome the latter. This is an unmissable opportunity for anyone looking to sharpen their journalistic skills. After the course you will be offered the opportunity to send your piece for publication in the Gordian, UN-aligned’s monthly publication. &lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/194953390_2893916164184528_7060861168912488824_n-copy.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
