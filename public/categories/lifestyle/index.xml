&lt;p>Hi. Why are train workers on strike? They earn more than teachers and nurses anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>✏️ &lt;strong>&lt;em>Ruby’s answer&lt;/em>&lt;/strong>:&lt;br>
Dear reader,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Congratulations and many thanks for pointing out that train workers are not the only overworked and underpaid sector in the UK. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RMT union coordinated a strike - which includes not just those “greedy, overpaid” drivers who I’m sure are buzzing about inconveniencing the public, but a whole host of workers key to the British rail infrastructure, from the train cleaner to the railway lubricator.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Unlikely-Agony-Aunt-Letters.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
