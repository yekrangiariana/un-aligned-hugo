&lt;p>Topics will range from international law and treaties to general crime and punishment. We will also be exploring the difference between what is legal and what is ethical, which are two very different animals. After all, most of the world’s problems today are caused by activities that are more or less legal everywhere, such as intensive animal farming, extraction and consumption of fossil fuels, suppression of human rights and exploitation. &lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Introduction-to-the-new-volume.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Update on UN-aligned’s open letter to the United Nations Human Rights Council</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/campaigns/update-on-un-aligneds-open-letter-to-the-united-nations-human-rights-council/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Mar 2022 11:11:13 +0200</pubDate><author>Ariana Yekrangi</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/campaigns/update-on-un-aligneds-open-letter-to-the-united-nations-human-rights-council/</guid><description>UN-aligned’s open letter to the UNHRC which called for a ban on countries that criminalise LGBTQ+ from forming part of the commission will be delayed owing to the latest developments in the United Nations and the ongoing war in Ukraine.</description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Update-on-UN-aligneds-open-letter-to-the-United-Nations-Human-Rights-Council-.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Celebrity islands with the United Nations</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/un-in-focus/celebrity-islands-with-the-united-nations/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 16:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>Ariana Yekrangi</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/un-in-focus/celebrity-islands-with-the-united-nations/</guid><description>Many may not know, but the United Nations is the creator of some of the worst “reality TV” of all time.

The ex-mayor of the Italian town of Riace has been chosen for his vision regarding the integration of refugees into their destination of choice, while at the same time revitalising a dying town.  Riace became a showcase of prosperity and integration and was hailed in 2016 by Fortune magazine as one of the world’s 50 greatest leaders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the 30th September 2021, Lucano was sentenced to 13 years in prison for abetting illegal migration. His “crimes” included awarding waste collection contracts to companies that were set up to help migrants look for work and arranging a marriage of convenience to help a Nigerian woman escape prostitution and find legal work. The accusation that he enriched himself in the process, seems contrived, considering he does not even have the funds to pay for his legal fees. &lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Domenico-Lucano-declared-as-UN-aligned-Person-of-the-Year.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Support The Gordian with a Patreon subscription</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/opportunities/support-the-gordian-with-a-patreon-subscription/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 17:43:50 +0200</pubDate><author>Ariana Yekrangi</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/opportunities/support-the-gordian-with-a-patreon-subscription/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Gordian Magazine is an open, independent publication that is read by hundreds of people around the world.

Her clients included opposition politicians, journalists, abused women and children, women who were arrested for not wearing the hijab and prisoners on death row for crimes they allegedly committed when they were minors. On several occasions she went on extended hunger strikes to protest against the severity of the prison regime.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Nasrin_Sotoudeh-copy.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Update on the Ashin Wirathu Campaign</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/update-on-the-afshin-wirathu-campaign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 07:00:51 +0200</pubDate><author>Adrian Liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/update-on-the-afshin-wirathu-campaign/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 27 July 2020, UN-aligned sent a &lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/letters/letter-to-mr-ashin-wirathu/">letter to the Burmese Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu&lt;/a> asking him, amongst other things, how he could reconcile his hostility to the Rohingya with his Buddhist creed. The letter was sent registered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three months later, the letter is still sitting in a post office in Myanmar and the status of the letter is described as “in transit.” The address was of course correct; in fact, the monastery he resides in is the well-known and accessible New Masoyein Monastery in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandalay">Mandalay&lt;/a>. So why on earth is the letter still stuck in Nowhere Land?&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/venerable-w-crop.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
