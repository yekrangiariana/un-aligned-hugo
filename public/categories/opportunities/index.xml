      <title>Onward and upwards: UN-aligned priorities for 2025</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/campaigns/call-to-action/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a successful AGM, during which Adrian Liberto was confirmed as Chair and Partho Chatterjee as Vice-Chair, UN-aligned would like to highlight some of the priorities for the remainder of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our first priority is to bolster our membership board with dedicated members who can propel the organisation forward. The mission remains the same: the creation of a united nations that is fit for purpose, supported by inviolable values, rather than subservience to the self-interest of dominant member-states. This we are now prepared to do in collaboration with those sectors of the current United Nations that are not compromised beyond redemption.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

An appointed executive committee, who will consist of UN-aligned staff and editors of the Gordian, will decide on the final winner. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;All articles in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/&#34;&gt;UN-aligned manifesto&lt;/a&gt; are important, but it is only natural that we will feel more attached to some rather than to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are particularly passionate about one of the articles in the manifesto, we would like you to consider becoming a voluntary Ambassador for that specific article.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The task will involve taking the standard and campaigning for that particular issue, with the full force of the organisation behind you. You will be giving guidance on how best to carry out this mission, as well as ongoing support. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
