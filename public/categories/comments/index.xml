      <description>Israel succeeded in killing journalist Anas Jamal Al-Sharif, but it could not silence him. In this posthumous letter, he testifies against those who &#34;accepted our killing,&#34; and entrusts his beloved daughter Sham, his son Salah, and the soul of his nation to a world he urges to finally act.</description>

      <description>In the late 20th century, women in other parts of the industrialised world had also experienced what is popularly known as the &#39;glass ceiling&#39; phenomenon, which meant that women found they could only rise to a certain level in corporations and no further.
