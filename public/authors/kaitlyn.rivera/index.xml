      <description>&lt;p&gt;From February 24th until now, nearly tens of thousands of people have been either injured or killed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is an unfortunate number of people, especially so when considering the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;with more than five million leaving Ukraine in search of safety. The people of Ukraine have been pushed from their homes, forced to leave behind their lives, families, friends, and pets; but they are resilient people and have given the world personal insights to life in Ukraine post-invasion. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Council of Europe is an organization that was founded in 1949 after the conclusion of the second World War. The council is composed of 47 member states with 27 of those states also being members of the European Union. The council operates on the mission of protecting and preserving human rights throughout its domain. This council was formed so that no atrocities such as those seen during World War II, would ever occur again. Since its inception, the Council of Europe has expanded to include six smaller councils and assemblies that actively work towards achieving goals such as abolitioning the death penalty, supporting children’s rights, ensuring fair and equal elections, and fighting for equal access to healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Climate refugees in the modern world</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A climate refugee is someone displaced from their home because of an extreme weather event caused by climate change. This particular category of refugees is coming from all over the world to various places that are not being affected as deeply by extreme weather. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is nothing new and neither is human migration. Migration has been a huge factor in international interactions since the dawn of written history. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Global climate change however, is a relatively recent occurrence. Climate change is defined as “the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a long period of time – including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns”. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

You are almost calling for this. You want it to happen”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
