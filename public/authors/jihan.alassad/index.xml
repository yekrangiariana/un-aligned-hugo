&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of a new month and the end of a whole year. This does not feel like the beginning of a month or a day or anything new. I am afraid because I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what is coming to me, and this idea is a big horror for me.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/My-religion-is-myself-and-my-nationality-is-my-heart-Five-days-inside-a-refugees-diary.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Disheartening revelations about the UNHCR in Lebanon — A refugee’s perspective</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/unhcr-in-lebanon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jan 2022 09:53:06 +0200</pubDate><author>jihan.alassad</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/unhcr-in-lebanon/</guid><description>The primary mission of the UNHCR is to provide emergency assistance to those forced to flee their homes, but how is this achieved in the current reality, especially in a Lebanon?</description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/The-UNHCR-in-Lebanon-is-not-doing-enough-%E2%80%94-A-refugees-perspective-.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Syrian Refugees Heading for Another Tough Winter</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/syrian-refugees-heading-for-another-tough-winter/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Dec 2021 12:10:24 +0200</pubDate><author>jihan.alassad</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/syrian-refugees-heading-for-another-tough-winter/</guid><description>&lt;p>The mere mention of the word ‘refugee’ immediately evokes scenes of pain, sadness, hardship and cold.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Syrian refugees in Lebanon seem fated to suffer in all seasons. After the summer heat they face a wave of frost and snow, with cracked tents that do not protect against cold or rain. In addition, the lack of heating, coupled with malnourished bodies, means that the coronavirus is much more of an existential threat. They suffer; just as migrants and other refugees do, whether it is on the Belarusian-Polish border or elsewhere.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Syrian-Refugees-Heading-for-Another-Tough-Winter.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
