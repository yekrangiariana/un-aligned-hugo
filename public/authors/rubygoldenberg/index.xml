      <title>Can we overcome the nuclear threat? | Ask Ruby</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear reader, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your great and timely question. Antonio Guterres recently called for “sending to the past” nuclear weapons and has said that the “world must abandon them forever”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice such statements are without actionable steps but that’s besides the point…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the majority of this year, the world has sat in a sort of gripped tension as the threat of “going nuclear” has escalated. Indeed the threat of nuclear weapons is synonymous with the end of the world. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear reader,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m delighted to have the opportunity to draw attention to the many references to other wars which we have in our archives. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have an excellent article on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-sanctions-dilemma/&#34;&gt;inefficiency of sanctions&lt;/a&gt; referring to the war in South Africa. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have written about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/how-the-recent-conflicts-in-syria-could-shape-its-future/&#34;&gt;Syrian war&lt;/a&gt; from various angles, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/interview-with-a-syrian-refugee-in-arsal-camp-lebanon/&#34;&gt;diary entries&lt;/a&gt; from Syrian refugees who have joined UN-aligned. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/gallery/surviving-the-victory-life-in-the-war-torn-gaza-strip-in-pictures/&#34;&gt;gallery&lt;/a&gt; of life in the war torn Gaza strip. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why are train workers on strike? They earn more than teachers and nurses anyway... | Ask Ruby</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi. Why are train workers on strike? They earn more than teachers and nurses anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;✏️ &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruby’s answer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Dear reader,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Congratulations and many thanks for pointing out that train workers are not the only overworked and underpaid sector in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The RMT union coordinated a strike - which includes not just those “greedy, overpaid” drivers who I’m sure are buzzing about inconveniencing the public, but a whole host of workers key to the British rail infrastructure, from the train cleaner to the railway lubricator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the third and final part of Noor&amp;rsquo;s story &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/at-school-in-70s-england/&#34;&gt;for this feature&lt;/a&gt;. Noor is sharing her experience as an immigrant child who came to England in the 70s from Morocco. At the time, Noor was still grappling with the English language and finding her place in High School.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have very vivid memories of 1977 specifically because it was the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Jubilee. There were huge street parties and a pure celebratory atmosphere on that day. By this time, my mum was on a road trip to Morocco and I&amp;rsquo;d stayed behind in England with my older sister.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1976 we moved to Poplar in London. One thing I remember is a Saturday market full of hustle and bustle, with working class people grabbing bargains under a wave of brightly coloured merchandise. We had moved into a four bedroomed Maisonette, not far from our new secondary school. We lived amongst a majority white community, but there was one black family who befriended my sister and I.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was February and incredibly cold. I remember walking to my new school that day with dread and fear twisting inside me. All that I could do was anticipate the worst things that could happen to me at the new school. The thought of having to face 30 children, not understanding much English, and trying to make sense of the school timetable, was nauseating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;4th-october-1974&#34;&gt;4th October 1974&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When I arrived in England, my first memory was walking through Heathrow Airport with my three sisters and one brother. I am the middle child of seven children, two of my siblings had already arrived in England before us. My mother was holding two of our hands, and the air hostesses were holding the rest of our little hands. My brother didn’t need his hand to be held and walked behind us as we approached Passport Control.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine visiting your mother or father in their home. When you arrive, you discover that they are in distress in front of the television. They look at you with fear in their eyes; you look at them and then to the ordinary television screen, not understanding the problem. Your mother or father imagines that the people on the television are home intruders, and they ask you how those people got into the house. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve pondered veganism but haven’t yet followed through, it may be that you are put off by the myth of the diet being restricted. As with any lifestyle change, slow and steady tends to lead to longevity. It is much better to gradually cut animal products from your diet permanently than trying to be a strict vegan for a month, falling off the wagon, and being put off enough to never try it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Amazon: An Update on UN-alinged’s Campaign</title>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/un-aligned-news/update-on-un-alingeds-amazon-campaign/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When UN-aligned launched our series of campaigns, we knew that asking the big and uncomfortable questions would not lead to quick and straightforward answers. So far, we have campaigned against &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/letters/letter-to-mr-ashin-wirathu/&#34;&gt;anti-Muslim sentiment spearheaded by Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have campaigned against &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/letters/iranian-protesters-to-be-hanged/&#34;&gt;the death penalty for three young Iranian protestors&lt;/a&gt; and are preparing campaigns against the discrimination of the LGBT+ community to religious and political leaders in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, our most dedicated readers may be able to recall the first campaign of UN-aligned, which was an open letter to Amazon to discuss their cardboard packaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Amazon,I am writing on behalf of UN-aligned. An alternative United Nations organization that seeks to put humanity before nationality and planet before greed. We consider topics ranging from the current United Nations, Human Rights, Environment, Economy and Trade. Today I am writing to you in relation to our commitment to the environment. In particular, our members are interested in schemes to limit the need for packaging and on this topic, we reach out to you for answers. Naturally, the scope of this is limitless, but I’d like to address to you some concerns regarding Amazons conscious effort towards sustainable packaging materials in your orders.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The importance of accessible tourist visas to balance our perception of Russia</title>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/global-issues/accessible-russian-tourist-visas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February 2020, Russia announced that it would soon be offering a simplified and cheaper online visa application for tourists from EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you were asked to describe Russia, your immediate thoughts may be of snow, bears and vodka. Unsurprisingly, Russia does contain all of those things. Think a little more and you might settle on political tension, corruption and the mafia. Unless you had visited, you probably would not envision the long summers in a cottage surrounded by countryside, LGBT activists, or a local taxi driver cracking jokes in elementary English. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
