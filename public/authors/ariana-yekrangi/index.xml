In this edition, we venture into the depths of a question that has, for centuries, puzzled and provoked: &#34;To be or not to be European alone&#34;. As we stand at the crossroads of history, the fabric of our collective identity is being stretched and tested by the forces of nationalism and globalisation, each tugging in its direction.</description>

In this re-emerging June issue of The Gordian, titled &#34;In The Fume of Power: The Greed of Giants&#34;, we confront the unchecked power of industry giants and the inherent dangers they pose. Of course, our explorations do not end here. The June issue presents a plethora of compelling articles penned by an array of thoughtful minds, including Dawn Roy, Alexander Stoney, Partho Pratim Chatterjee, Omar Alansari-Kreger, Jihan Al-Assad, Carla Pietrobattista and Alex Liberto.
