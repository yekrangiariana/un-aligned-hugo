      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pyrocumulonimbus clouds—towering thunderclouds born from wildfire heat—are becoming an increasingly dangerous force in today’s fire-prone world. Unlike typical storm clouds, these massive systems form when the intense heat from large wildfires creates powerful updrafts, carrying smoke, ash, and moisture high into the atmosphere. As the rising air cools and condenses, it forms thunderclouds that do far more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Far from offering relief, pyrocumulonimbus clouds often worsen fire conditions. They generate lightning capable of sparking new fires miles away from the original blaze, while their strong winds can fan existing flames, pushing wildfires across vast stretches of land with alarming speed. Despite their storm-like appearance, these clouds rarely produce significant rainfall—leaving the fires beneath them undoused and free to spread.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Global warming, a crisis primarily driven by the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, calls for innovative solutions. Our reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation, transportation, industrial processes and domestic heating has exponentially escalated carbon dioxide levels. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gas is a significant contributor to the greenhouse effect, which in turn accelerates global warming. But what if we could transform this problem into a solution? Here are four ways we can utilise carbon dioxide to help keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/climate-emergency/unlocking-the-power-of-a-thriving-bioeconomy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As we face the pressing issue of climate change, it&amp;rsquo;s clear that we need solutions that are both sustainable and equitable. That&amp;rsquo;s where the concept of a bioeconomy comes in. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By harnessing renewable resources, a bioeconomy has the potential to not only help mitigate emissions, but also support communities that have been historically marginalised, such as forest dwellers, farmers and indigenous populations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in order to fully realise the benefits of a bioeconomy, we need to ensure that it is supported by smart policies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The contemporary phenomena of global warming has created a &amp;ldquo;Hothouse Earth&amp;rdquo; and has wreaked havoc on pristine ecosystems. The melting of glaciers exposes vast swathes of marine water to atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering pH from alkaline values and threatening the survival of corals and other marine organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the indiscriminate felling of certain species of flora and the poaching of certain species of animals for medicinal purposes exacerbates their extinction. Clearing tropical rainforests for agriculture also strips the planet of its carbon sinks and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Energy is one of the inalienable stanchions of modern human-social-industrial life. The current global temperature is 1.1 degree centigrade above pre-industrial levels. The recent devastating events like increase in glacial lake outburst floods,  droughts , cyclones, forest fires, and the like could be attributed to the rising global temperatures. As the pernicious effects of global warming are now no longer covert, it is high time to resort to decarbonisation using a combination of efficient technologies and carbon dioxide sequestration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to combat forest fires: causes and 4 solutions</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/climate-emergency/how-to-combat-forest-fires-causes-and-4-solutions/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, forest fires are proliferating. The current temperature is around 1.1. degree centigrade above pre-industrial levels. This increase in temperature could be attributed to anthropogenic activity-induced global warming. The concentration of gases like carbon dioxide is increasing continuously in the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities like fossil fuel-based power generation and the use of fossil fuels in internal combustion engines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, USA recorded high amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases trap infrared radiation leading to a spike in global temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Water is one of the stanchions of life. Around 60 % of the human body is made up of water. Drinking water from pristine sources has been linked to a higher lifespan. Water provides oxygen in the form of dissolved oxygen to marine organisms. Global warming leads to an increase in the temperature of the water. This reduces the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water proving detrimental for aquatic life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to Make Transportation Green? 3 Alternatives to Internal Combustion Engines</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/climate-emergency/how-to-make-transportation-green-3-alternatives-to-internal-combustion-engines/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/climate-emergency/how-to-make-transportation-green-3-alternatives-to-internal-combustion-engines/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pollution from transportation is an inexorable contributor towards climate change. Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) powered vehicles use fossil fuels like Compressed Natural Gas, Gasoline, Diesel etc. Here, an interesting trend is observed. The higher the hydrocarbon, the greater is the extent of pollution caused because of it. This could be attributed to the presence of a larger number of impurities in the liquid stage compared to the gaseous stage. Thus, the extent of environmental pollution caused by Diesel powered vehicles is greater than Natural Gas based vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;remediation-and-restoration&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remediation and restoration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Terrestrial ecosystem restoration can be augmented with novel afforestation techniques like Miyawaki method thereby increasing biodiversity along with sequestering greenhouse gasses. Marine ecosystems can be restored by techniques like Floating Solar PhotoVoltaics, offshore wind farms, wind-Solar hybrids and powered Biorock accretion techniques followed by the insertion of a living coral in the skeleton to enhance biodiversity in these “rainforests” of the oceans. Oil spills from ships can have a pernicious effect on fragile marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-clean-energy-imperative&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Clean Energy Imperative&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Clean energy sources like solar, wind, hydropower and nuclear energy have low Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE). This makes electricity purchase from clean energy sources more economically viable and environmentally sustainable for domestic as well as commercial applications. Therefore, increasing the share of clean energy sources in the energy generation mix is essentially advisable. Historically, developing nations have been dependent upon fossil fuel based power generation at large to meet their primary energy requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;an-ode-to-environmental-restoration&#34;&gt;An Ode to Environmental Restoration&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Human Beings since the onset of the Industrial Revolution have been obtuse,&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The contemporary generation now finds the effects of global warming abstruse. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The pernicious effects of climate change are no longer covert, &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Floods, droughts, and forest fires have now become rampant and overt. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The indiscriminate chopping of trees, which we would all agree, &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Has pared the earth’s carbon sinks to a substantial degree. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is high time that the words of the environmentalists are heard, &lt;br&gt;&#xA;Or our next generations might not hear the chirp of a single bird.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
