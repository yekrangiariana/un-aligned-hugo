      <description>&lt;p&gt;The President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, has signed an Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA), outlawing homosexuality in the country. Uganda&amp;rsquo;s penal code already prohibits same-sex conduct, but the new bill, signed on the 26th of May, introduced the death penalty for acts classified as “aggravated homosexuality”, which includes spreading HIV, rape and serial offending. Moreover, it raised the imprisonment term for same-sex conduct to 10 years, while a 20-year sentence could be handed to anyone promoting homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Corruption is paid by the poor,&amp;rdquo; warns Pope Francis, highlighting an unsettling reality: those least able to afford it, endure corruption&amp;rsquo;s harshest consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The publication of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022&#34;&gt;Corruption Perceptions Index&lt;/a&gt; 2022 (CPI), which uses a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), has shed light on the efforts taken by policymakers to combat corruption in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The report indicates that out of the 180 countries assessed, 124 have made no progress in fighting corruption across any levels. This staggering statistic underscores the severity and pervasiveness of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 4th 2023, Dubai announced an 8.7 trillion-dollar expansion plan as a part of its diversification plan to shift its focus from revenues generated from oil reserves. The emirate aspires to become a global financial hub by boosting its manufacturing and logistics, making it an attractive proposition for foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vision 2030&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another diversification strategy under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to reduce its dependence on hydrocarbons. The government estimates it can raise 1 trillion riyals in non-governmental revenue and decrease the unemployment rate from 12% to 7% by 2030. Qatar also positions itself to be one of the emerging investment destinations by implementing the policies from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gco.gov.qa/en/about-qatar/national-vision2030/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qatar National Vision 2030&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
