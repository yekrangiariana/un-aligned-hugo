&lt;p>The end of the war left a sense of discontent and disillusionment, especially with the younger generation. As society developed into a more affluent capitalistic and class-conscious structure, the younger generation became aware that the poorer classes were being exploited and this prompted them to voice their anger. A new class of writers, known as the Angry Young Men, came into being. They were expressing their anger through various literary genres, in particular through prose and drama.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Photo-John-Osbornes-Wikipedia-page..jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Harold Pinter: a mirror for the common people</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/culture/harold-pinter-a-mirror-for-the-common-people/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 12:50:05 +0200</pubDate><author>alex.liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/culture/harold-pinter-a-mirror-for-the-common-people/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the last issue we saw how Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter &lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/culture/samuel-beckett-harold-pinter-two-giants-of-the-theatre-of-the-absurd/">developed a new drama&lt;/a> that was characterized by features that had nothing in common with the prevailing criteria of the time: the Theatre of the Absurd.

Protesting against society and the situation of man, but in a different way, were the giants of the Theatre of the Absurd Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. Both playwrights developed a new drama which was characterised by features that had nothing in common with the prevailing criteria of the time. &lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Giants-of-the-Theatre-of-the-Absurd-.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>The Dystopian Novel: "Beyond Utopia"!</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/culture/the-dystopian-novel-beyond-utopia/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 11:00:00 +0300</pubDate><author>alex.liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/culture/the-dystopian-novel-beyond-utopia/</guid><description>&lt;p>The dystopian novel developed during the 20th century when the reality of humanity’s volatile condition became evident after both the first and second world wars. The word, dystopia, refers to Utopia, the fictitious name of an ideal country, coined by Thomas More in his famous book Libellus &amp;hellip; de optimo reipublicae statu deque nova Insula &lt;a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2130">Utopia (1516)&lt;/a>. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was designed as a political, social and religious system which was not supposed to be reflected in reality, but proposed as an ideal model.  &lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/George-Orwell-1981.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby VS T.

My last article on &lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/culture/your-guide-to-t-s-eliot-poems/">T. S. Eliot’s poetic portrayal of the early 20th century&lt;/a> ended with the line, “The dehumanisation of the modern world is complete.” This ‘dehumanisation’, which Eliot portrayed as a waste land in his poetry, was also described very clearly in prose by F.

Like the &lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/culture/john-donne-life-career-and-poems/">17th century poet, John Donne&lt;/a>, Eliot veered from the ethereal world of romance and idealisation, to head directly towards a concrete reality through conceits and extended metaphors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His work reflected the upheaval of the social order in the aftermath of World War I, and the failure of all of man’s social, political and philosophical aspirations. On the wake of death and destruction, all seemed to flounder on the crags of a festering humanity that had turned to superficial desires and material gain. Ethical and moral values were reduced to a vast expanse of ash and aridity; a waste land void of any humanity. Humankind had lost its soul.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/T.S-Eliot-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>John Donne's No Man is an Island: Feeling a Oneness With Humanity</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/culture/donne-no-man-is-an-island-and-feeling-a-oneness-with-the-rest-of-humanity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Mar 2021 08:38:21 +0200</pubDate><author>alex.liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/culture/donne-no-man-is-an-island-and-feeling-a-oneness-with-the-rest-of-humanity/</guid><description>&lt;p>In today’s world besieged by isolationism, America First, Britain First, white supremacy, cyber bullying, homophobia, racism, vaccine tug-of-war, colonialist withdrawal symptoms (… shall I go on?) and the like, never before have the words of John Donne been more relevant; “No man is an island…”. In the age of Brexit, the very notion that every man is part of a greater humanity is a powerful assertion. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the profound conviction that ‘every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main’ has a far more universal metaphorical significance; a spiritual and existential significance.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/John-Donne.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>"The Greatest Metaphysical Poet": Your Full Guide to John Donne’s Life, Career &amp; Poems</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/culture/john-donne-life-career-and-poems/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 14:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>alex.liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/culture/john-donne-life-career-and-poems/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="family-background">&lt;strong>Family background&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>John Donne was born in London in 1572 to a relatively wealthy family.  His father, who died when Donne was only four, was a successful tradesman and his mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of the writer John Heywood.  Both parents were Roman Catholics and were in obvious difficulty to come to terms with the newly established Church of England.  Donne’s family, especially on his mother’s side, were persecuted for being Roman Catholics and for refusing to swear the Oath of Supremacy which acknowledged the English monarch as the Head of the Church of England.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/8.jpg.webp" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Samuel Pepys: A peep into the life of a gentleman in the Restoration period</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/culture/samuel-pepys-a-peep-into-the-life-of-a-gentleman-in-the-restoration-period/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Dec 2020 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>alex.liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/culture/samuel-pepys-a-peep-into-the-life-of-a-gentleman-in-the-restoration-period/</guid><description>&lt;p>We cannot speak of a literary career for Samuel Pepys (1633 -1703), since he wrote predominantly for his own private reading. He is known for his diary which was written in a special code (Shelton’s system of tachygraphy) and was not meant to have been deciphered and read by others.  This naturally makes his account of life during the Restoration period free from prejudice and all the more authentic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The diary of Pepys is of paramount importance since it illustrates an informative and unique picture of Restoration life. It is a stunning self-portrait of the middle-class gentleman whose social position exemplifies the Restoration years of readjustment.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/10.jpg.webp" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Evolution Gaming fires hundreds of employees as it buys NetEnt for $2.1 billion</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/news/evolution-gaming-fires-hundreds-of-employees-as-it-buys-netent-for-2-1-billion/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Dec 2020 14:38:14 +0200</pubDate><author>alex.liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/news/evolution-gaming-fires-hundreds-of-employees-as-it-buys-netent-for-2-1-billion/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>The following article, written by Alex Liberto, concerns one of our Maltese members who was a victim of a ruthless mass sacking following the takeover of one company by another.  Sadly, the coronavirus has already caused havoc in the jobs market around the world, but if anyone one can suggest what UN-aligned can do to support these people, please &lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/about/contact/">let us know&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
