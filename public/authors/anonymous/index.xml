We have all had to adapt to new changes and the impact COVID-19 has had worldwide.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am a classroom teacher based in a primary school in London. Since April, we have had to face many challenges due to the pandemic. Children have done an amazing job at adapting to necessary changes and staff have been very supportive of each other. We worked flexibly and creatively to help the school run as efficiently and effectively as possible. This last term, however, has been particularly draining for all of us!&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/people-wearing-diy-masks-3951623.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>North Korea: A convenient pawn</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/north-korea-a-convenient-pawn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Sep 2020 10:55:48 +0300</pubDate><author>Anonymous</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/north-korea-a-convenient-pawn/</guid><description>&lt;p>North Korea is usually in the headlines for reasons ranging from the terrifying to the bizarre. This month, their leader Kim Jong-Un is once again subject to rumours that he is dead. This is the second time since April that the speculation has emerged and been dismissed by North Korea. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Much time can be spent considering what would have to occur in order for the regime to collapse. Some speculate that the death of Kim Jong-Un could have a snowball effect on North Korea as we know it.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/9-1.jpg.webp" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Letters: The Lives of Three Iranian Protestors are on the Line - Take Action Now</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/campaigns/iranian-protesters-to-be-hanged/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 14:57:03 +0300</pubDate><author>Anonymous</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/campaigns/iranian-protesters-to-be-hanged/</guid><description>&lt;p>On Tuesday morning, a spokesman for Iran&amp;rsquo;s judiciary confirmed the death sentence of three young men who were participants in the nationwide unrest that swept across the country in November 2019. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The “November protests” started with anger over the government&amp;rsquo;s decision to increase diesel prices, and soon developed into violent clashes between police and  protestors, with many chanting slogans against the Islamic Republic. Protests also echoed concerns over an increasing assault on individual liberties by the Iranian establishment, massive corruption scandals and a dying economy in which many struggle to make ends meet.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/113190050_f13a16a3-ba31-428e-b597-3418fd2b04dc.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
