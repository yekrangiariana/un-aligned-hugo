&lt;p>This may all be in good will, however studies suggest that there are serious side effects to the use of traditional Chinese medicine. In a corrupt world where the responsible organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), have such strong political bounds to governmental entities, such as the Chinese Communist Party, it becomes our duty, as members of the society, to inform others on such crucial matters, especially when it could be a matter of life and death such as this one.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/The-Use-of-Chinese-Medicine-in-Treating-Covid-19-1.png" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Document no. 3 and what it reveals about the Chinese Communist Party</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/china-is-lying-about-the-coronavirus-document-no-3-reavels/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 May 2020 07:07:40 +0300</pubDate><author>aryan.yekrangi</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/china-is-lying-about-the-coronavirus-document-no-3-reavels/</guid><description>&lt;p>China is lying about the coronavirus, document no.3 reveals&lt;/p>
