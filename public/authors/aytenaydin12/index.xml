&lt;p>In the Palaeozoic era, an order of molluscs with red shells, called ammonites, had spread through all the sea since they had the ability not just to live underwater, but also to expel water from their shell and thus rise and descend. Their success with respect to other forms of life led them to reproduce until they saturated their environment and became extinct. The reason is the uncontainable growth of the species.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/6691281879_d67effd43f_c.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>The Growth Dilemma</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/economy/the-growth-dilemma/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Apr 2021 11:08:48 +0300</pubDate><author>AytenAydin12</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/economy/the-growth-dilemma/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Italiano_-Il-dilemma-della-crescita.pdf">Read this article in Italian (Leggi questo articolo in italiano) →&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Society is faced with a profound dilemma. To reject growth is to risk economic and social collapse. To pursue it relentlessly is to endanger the ecosystems on which we depend for long term survival. This delusional strategy has reached its limits. Simplistic assumptions that capitalism’s propensity for efficiency will stabilise the climate and solve the problems of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/The-growth-dilemma-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Taming The Governing Strategies of Ongoing Socio-Economic Development by Way of G-Localization</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/culture/taming-the-governing-strategies-of-ongoing-socio-economic-development-by-way-of-g-localization/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Mar 2021 09:31:10 +0200</pubDate><author>AytenAydin12</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/culture/taming-the-governing-strategies-of-ongoing-socio-economic-development-by-way-of-g-localization/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Italiano_-Domare-le-strategie-che-governano-lo-sviluppo-socio-economico-in-corso-attraverso-la-G-Localizzazione.pdf">&lt;em>Read this article in Italian (Leggi questo articolo in italiano) →&lt;/em>&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The aim of this reflection is to create favourable conditions for progress by mobilizing the intellectual, spiritual and material forces with a sense of belonging to one and the same human community. This requires finding new ways of living in society and of facing the future together. Living organisms compete for resources, but collaborate for sustaining life on Earth.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Design-03.03.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
