      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many people who love their companion animals, it may be surprising how so many animals wind up in shelters unclaimed, says Jill Tucker, CEO of California Animal Welfare Association&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tucker, who originally started her career in software, shifted into the animal sector in 2003, where she moved from California to Vermont to run an animal humane society organisation. From starting as a foster parent to making her way as the president of that same organisation, Tucker found herself as a leader in protecting animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; 4 cups (946.35 ml) of peeled sliced peaches&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; ½ cup (118.3 ml)  of water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; 2 cups (473.17 ml) of organic sugar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; 1 ½ cups (354.88 ml) of self-rising flour (must be self-rising!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; 1 ½ cups (354.88 ml) of almond milk&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 stick (8 tbsp) vegan butter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ground cinnamon &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Suggested toppings: vegan vanilla ice cream&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-make-it&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Heat oven to 350°F /176 °C/gas 4 and let warm up while prepping the cobbler.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Place a medium (3Q) saucepan on the stove and set the heat to medium. Pour peaches, water, and 1 cup (236.59 ml) of sugar into the pan and mix. Let heat for about 10 minutes and mix occasionally. Set aside when done. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take out another medium mixing bowl. Pour in self-rising flour and 1 cup (236.59 ml) sugar and mix. Next, pour in almond milk and mix together. Set bowl aside. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take 1 stick ( 8 tbsp) of butter and heat until soft (Do not melt entirely!). Take soft butter and spread it into a 9x9 glass baking dish. Take the mixture from the bowl and pour it evenly into the dish. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Next, take the peaches from the pan and drain the water. Using a spoon, evenly spread peaches over the mixture in the dish. Then, take a generous amount of cinnamon and sprinkle it over top of the cobbler. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Place cobbler into the oven and bake for approx. 45-50 minutes. Timing may vary. Take the cobbler out of the oven and set it aside to cool down for about 5-10 minutes. Serve with vegan vanilla ice cream and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tip: To check if the mixture is baked to your liking, take the pan out of the oven. Take a fork or knife and poke into the mixture. If a bit of mixture is still left on the utensil, feel free to bake the cobbler for another 10 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Disclaimer: The recipe was made with non-organic sugar. In order to be a completely vegan recipe, be sure to use organic sugar. Timing may vary based on this change.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

Following the incident, the US Interior Department began their investigation of US schools and uncovered over nine graves of indigenous children at the Carlisle Indian Industrial school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States. What followed since has brought forth to the colonist public’s attention the systemic destruction of indigenous communities, cultures, and peoples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Mridul Wadhwa, and I am originally from India, and I’ve lived in Scotland since 2004. I started working in the violence against women or gender-based violence sector in 2005. With a small break in between, I’ve worked in that sector since then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I primarily worked with minority ethnic women, immigrant women, and women from communities of colour living in Scotland. For most of that time, my job was to work with the white majority community, primarily service providers, to help them develop an understanding of what kind of barriers minority ethnic women in Scotland face when experiencing and leaving abusive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Michelle Bachelet Jeria, I am writing to you on behalf of UN-aligned, a Finland-based NGO whose mission is to create a better and fairer United Nations that promotes ethical principles of human rights, animal welfare, environmental well-being, and world peace. Pertaining to human rights and global justice, I request that the OHCHR address and take action to eliminate harmful conversion practices that promote violence and invalidate the LGBTQIA+ community worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Overturning of Roe v. Wade: Here’s what this will mean</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/explainer/the-overturning-of-roe-v-wade-heres-what-this-will-mean/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United States Supreme Court ruled on January 22, 1973, that under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a person’s choice on whether or not to have an abortion was protected in the United States and could not be criminalized. This constitutional right would stand for nearly 50 years and result in safer abortion procedures and reproductive healthcare that saved lives across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the developing decision was leaked prior to its final release, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep410113/&#34;&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/a&gt; was officially overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 24, 2022, marking the erasure of progress for human reproductive rights in the U.S. and leaving the decision of legalizing abortion up to the states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
