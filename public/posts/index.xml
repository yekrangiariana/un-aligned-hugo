      <title>The Zionist experiment has failed: it must be abolished</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some ideas are not up for debate. They are autopsies. You do not reason with a tumor; you remove it. Zionism, as a political project, is that malignancy, and the state of Israel its grotesque outgrowth. To advocate for a “two-state solution”—a partition of historic Palestine that enshrines an explicitly Jewish ethno-state—is no longer just a failure of imagination. It is moral idiocy: a mumbled incantation over a corpse, serving only to buy the murderers more time. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Kakistocracy Sanctions Humanity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday July 9, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced the imposition of sanctions by the United States under a Presidential Executive Order targeting Francesca Albanese, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Palestine. Her crime? Speaking the truth about the Gaza genocide and those who profit from it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;United Nations representatives of Human Rights Council lost no time in expressing their objections, but of course in the customary UN watered-down sort of way. Meanwhile, on the same day, Wednesday 10, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu left Washington after two days of meetings with Trump and more US protection and support for his country’s genocide against Gaza.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;The last straw for the genocidaires was Albanese’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/hrbodies/hrcouncil/sessions-regular/session59/advance-version/a-hrc-59-23-aev.pdf&#34;&gt;Report&lt;/a&gt; published on June 16 that unequivocally exposed their heinous crimes, their accomplices and the heartless greed that motivates them. The Summary sets the scene nicely:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Another US Condemns Gaza to Further Genocide </title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/another-us-veto-supporting-genocide/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Trump and Netanyahu cosy up in Washington again with fresh talks on Gaza, one thing is certain: there is no Israeli atrocity, however diabolical, that the US will not back. Here I pick at Dorothy Shea’s narrative after yet another US veto blocking moves to put an end to the genocide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Dorothy Shea (acting US Representative at the UN), as you rightly suggest, your 4 June 2025 veto on the resolution to put an end to the carnage in Gaza comes as no surprise. Your country has not only undermined every possible attempt to stop the genocide, vetoing resolution after resolution, but is actively involved in perpetrating it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UN-aligned recently partnered with &lt;a href=&#34;https://fled.ong/&#34;&gt;FLED Nicaragua&lt;/a&gt; to translate their annual report from Spanish into English, highlighting the grave state of press freedom in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The assassination of retired Nicaraguan army officer and outspoken critic of President Daniel Ortega, Roberto Samcam, on June 19 while in exile in Costa Rica, underscores the urgency of the crisis and the critical need to raise international awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Press-Freedom-Report-January%E2%80%93March-2025-%E2%80%93-Copy.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read full report -&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sky-Born Infernos: How Pyrocumulonimbus Clouds Supercharge Wildfires</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/climate-emergency/sky-born-infernos-the-deadly-feedback-loop-of-pyrocumulonimbus-clouds/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pyrocumulonimbus clouds—towering thunderclouds born from wildfire heat—are becoming an increasingly dangerous force in today’s fire-prone world. Unlike typical storm clouds, these massive systems form when the intense heat from large wildfires creates powerful updrafts, carrying smoke, ash, and moisture high into the atmosphere. As the rising air cools and condenses, it forms thunderclouds that do far more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Far from offering relief, pyrocumulonimbus clouds often worsen fire conditions. They generate lightning capable of sparking new fires miles away from the original blaze, while their strong winds can fan existing flames, pushing wildfires across vast stretches of land with alarming speed. Despite their storm-like appearance, these clouds rarely produce significant rainfall—leaving the fires beneath them undoused and free to spread.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Confronting a Genocide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the “business as usual” attitude of most of the world’s politicians and the people the media like to keep in the spotlight, the genocidaires are hurting. The protests, the immolations, the hunger strikes, the courageous acts of defiance… They are slowly taking their toll. The genocidaires know that even if they managed to kill every single Palestinian living in Gaza and the West Bank, they will always be branded as mass-murderers. And now, on the first day of June, another remarkable challenge: Greta Thunberg and other 11 activists have set sail towards Gaza on the Madleen, a small ship operated the Freedom Flotilla, to dent the siege and raise “international awareness” to the atrocities that are being committed by Israel. Speaking before her departure, the brave activist acknowledged the dangers involved, but equally the more insidious risks of doing nothing: “Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it’s not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide.” Activists on board include “Game of Thrones” actor Liam Cunningham and French member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan. They are expected to reach Gaza in about a week’s time. Unsurprisingly, haughty critics soon attacked from their Pro- Zionist ivory towers. Republican senator Lindsey Graham, sneered: “Hope Greta and her friends can swim!”; while Brendan&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>More than Just a Gay Icon: Edmund White (1940-2025) </title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“When we are young… we often experience things in the present with a nostalgia-in-advance, but we seldom guess what we will truly prize years from now.” (City boy: My Life in New York in the 1960s and 70s)&lt;br&gt;&#xA;As the outpouring of tributes to author Edmund White continues to flood the world, I cannot help feeling how the man, Edmund White, would have reacted to the adulation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was a very reserved and unassuming gentle soul, with a wicked sense of humour; always on board for a laugh. I met Edmund several years back when I was a lecturer at the American University of Rome. Our first encounter was fraught with laughter and surreptitious jokes. He was about to give a talk and a reading of his book A Married Man at John Cabot University in Trastevere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Call to Action!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/un-aligned-news/onward-and-upwards/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Standing by, while destructive, self-serving oligarchs destroy our planet and the international order, is not an option. UN-aligned&amp;rsquo;s warnings about the dangers of the United Nations, in particular its dominance by the Five Permanent Members of the Security Council, could have proved prophetic, had the writing not been on the wall from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite some well-functioning aspects of the organisation and some remarkable people, like the Secretary General himself and the Special Rapporteur for Palestine, Francesca Albanese, who is truly outstanding, the structure of the organisation does not allow it to meet the dire challenges the world is facing in these unpresented times. We, “the people”, need to mobilise; make sure our voices are heard; we need to stand up for every citizen of this planet and the planet itself. In order to achieve this more effectively we are looking for dedicated people to join our Board and bring our mission forward according to the urgency the time demands. So, whatever your skills, please contact &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:adrian.liberto@un-aligned.org&#34;&gt;adrian.liberto@un-aligned.org&lt;/a&gt; to see how you can take on a leading role in UN-aligned and be at the forefront of our action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Onward and upwards: UN-aligned priorities for 2025</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/campaigns/call-to-action/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a successful AGM, during which Adrian Liberto was confirmed as Chair and Partho Chatterjee as Vice-Chair, UN-aligned would like to highlight some of the priorities for the remainder of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our first priority is to bolster our membership board with dedicated members who can propel the organisation forward. The mission remains the same: the creation of a united nations that is fit for purpose, supported by inviolable values, rather than subservience to the self-interest of dominant member-states. This we are now prepared to do in collaboration with those sectors of the current United Nations that are not compromised beyond redemption.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Beyond Trumpian Flirtations with Total Denuclearization</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Is Donald Trump to be taken seriously when openly speaking of denuclearization? The Center for Public Integrity reported in an article from 2020 on the future of warfare that the nuclear weapons industry under Trump&amp;rsquo;s first term flourished to heights not seen since before the end of the Cold War. He effectively catapulted an aggressive nuclear rearming of America at an estimated 1.7 trillion-dollar cost to the American taxpayer. Despite the massive cost, politicians like Republican Senator Deb Fischer argued that the nuclear rearming of America in a multipolar world is to be considered an essential but not sufficient national security imperative, implying the 1.7 trillion-dollar price tag for the nuclear rearming of America is substantively insufficient. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>4 Ways to Use Carbon Dioxide to Curb Global Warming</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Global warming, a crisis primarily driven by the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, calls for innovative solutions. Our reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation, transportation, industrial processes and domestic heating has exponentially escalated carbon dioxide levels. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This gas is a significant contributor to the greenhouse effect, which in turn accelerates global warming. But what if we could transform this problem into a solution? Here are four ways we can utilise carbon dioxide to help keep the global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Held Hostage No More’: Harris, Democrats and the Price of Betrayal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First as tragedy, then as farce, and now—an endless cycle of farce, like a bad political rerun that won’t quit. America has rewarded its own worst instincts by returning to office an anti-women, climate-denying, xenophobic figure who has openly admired authoritarianism. This isn’t an anomaly; it’s déjà vu—again. Trump’s re-election isn’t an outlier but a pattern that shatters any pretence of America being better than this. It isn’t, and it’s high time we stopped pretending otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Karma often comes with a sting, as the old saying goes. After eight years of stoking division, Donald Trump almost got a taste of the chaos he helped create. He was on the verge of experiencing the kind of horror faced by 378,000 US students who &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/interactive/school-shootings-database/&#34;&gt;have died from guns&lt;/a&gt; since the Columbine High School massacre in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This time, Trump nearly found himself in the same dire straits as over 37,000 Palestinians—who lost their lives as he &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-israel-gaza-finish-problem-rcna141905#&#34;&gt;cheered on Israel&lt;/a&gt; to “finish the problem” with bombs proudly stamped Made in the USA, and literally signed off by a Republican cheerleaders in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Corral (1881), stipulates “the right of the people to keep and bear Arms”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>“We’ve seen this before”: Inside Israel’s war on truth, journalists and the free media</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first casualty in any assault is invariably the truth. But what is it about journalists that tyrants find so terrifying? It is the fear of empowerment that comes with knowledge. Despots thrive in the shadows that ignorance casts, manipulating and controlling through a cocktail of misinformation and deceit. Yet, a journalist can spark a flame in our mind, capable of incinerating the very foundations of tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hiding the truth is not merely the erratic behaviour of the paranoid or the despotically inclined; it is a clear indication of inherent weakness. A government that stands firm in its legitimacy and moral authority does not flinch at criticism nor recoil from dissent. It is the inherent brittleness of despotic rule that dreads the light of scrutiny, much like a rotten structure teetering on the verge of collapse at the merest prod.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Should you encounter the rare sight of individuals rallying in support of Israel&amp;rsquo;s actions in Gaza, your attention might be drawn to an unexpected symbol: a variant of the Iranian flag. This particular flag, adorned with the Lion and Sun against a backdrop of green, white and red, harks back to Iran&amp;rsquo;s monarchical past.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This ensign, displayed alongside Israel&amp;rsquo;s, hails from a time when monarchs reigned over Iran, now seized upon by a diverse array within the Iranian diaspora, particularly those championing freedom in Iran, which includes the monarchists also known as Pahlavis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just recently, amidst the clinking glasses and idle chatter of a social gathering, I ventured to pierce this bubble. I posed a question to my friends, seemingly simple yet laden with the weight of untold suffering, which asked for their thoughts on the current mass slaughter of Palestinians by Israel; an atrocity that enjoys, astonishingly, the tacit approval—if not outright support—of our governments. One friend, embodying the spirit of our age&amp;rsquo;s indifference, confessed to avoiding the subject altogether. The casual dismissal struck me—not for its rarity, but for its brazenness, as if the very act of engagement with such a grave matter was itself a burden too heavy to bear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Israel is as good as finished. It has lost all credibility as a responsible nation in-the-making. From the onset its creation has depended on abusing superpowers, injustice and crime. It has been those three forces that have kept it enduring and spreading until now, while skilfully dodging every attempt to hold it to account, often by playing the victim. Despite the numerous massacres perpetrated along the way, something very different has happened now that has shaken its very foundations; mortally so: Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As we stand at the crossroads of history, the fabric of our collective identity is being stretched and tested by the forces of nationalism and globalisation, each tugging in its direction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Revitalising Global Engagement: The Case for a United Nations Peace Corps</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations is as much an organisation of ironies as it is of stark contradictions. This is particularly true when comparing geopolitical power differentials between the global North and South. It is therefore unsurprising that the annual budgetary contributions of United Nations member states are calculated using strictly the US dollar. Based on details from the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), an article on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cfr.org/article/funding-united-nations-what-impact-do-us-contributions-have-un-agencies-and-programs&#34;&gt;American subsidisation of the United Nations&lt;/a&gt; revealed that one-fifth of the world&amp;rsquo;s premier supranational organisation is directly subsidised by the United States, to the tune of $12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 27th of January, a day after Israel was ordered by the International Court of Justice to take all measures to prevent its genocidal acts in Gaza, Germany, Canada, the UK and six other Western nations joined the US in pausing funding for the UN Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA). This decision followed Israel’s allegation that 12 UNRWA employees were involved in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UNRWA, a UN agency founded in 1949 by the UN General Assembly, responded by terminating the employment of the accused individuals and initiating a thorough investigation. Secretary-General António Guterres expressed his horror at the allegations, stating that those found guilty would face criminal prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Michelangelo’s &#34;Fruit Basket&#34; captures the fleeting essence of life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always postponed examining the canvas: the &amp;ldquo;Fruit Basket&amp;rdquo; for various, and undoubtedly futile, reasons. The first and foremost relates to the subjects, or rather objects to be examined. In fact, the absence of any human presence seemed to me to be an almost insurmountable hurdle in my search for feelings, in contrast to the various subjects depicted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/caravaggio/&#34;&gt;Caravaggio in his other works&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, the setting of the canvas also initially blocked me, because it lacked the obvious theatricality of Merisi&amp;rsquo;s Roman works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Wealth at Whistle&#39;s Blow: The Importance of Financial Planning for Athletes</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you won a million dollars? How would you spend it? It is a hypothetical question often considered when dreaming of the luxuries that come with a large paycheck. Now, imagine being 21 and signing a $100 USD million contract. It is not a lottery prize, but a reality for some of the world’s top athletes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a select few athletes, this hypothetical becomes a reality. In the last decade of sports, contracts in all the major sports leagues have risen exponentially. In 2008, baseball star Alex Rodriguez &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.firmex.com/resources/uncategorized/when-did-athletes-start-getting-rich/.&#34;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; a historic, 10-year, $275 million contract with the New York Yankees. His lucrative contract garnered attention as the largest contract ever to be signed in North American professional sports.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>To be or not to be European alone: Horizons of EU expansion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/horizons-of-eu-expansion/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/horizons-of-eu-expansion/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Europe is a continent; a land mass. Politically, of course, Europe is much more. It is an entity. The history of its various nations interlaces intricately, more so than with other parts of the world, as does its culture. Its aspirations are also different, though many of these overlap with those of people all around the world. The EU encapsulates some of these hopes, such as a desire for peace, security, justice and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the backseat of a taxi, a simple chat took a jarring turn, plunging me into a story that is all too common yet often goes untold. My goal was straightforward: to land a full-time role at a publishing house. However, what unfolded was an unexpected confrontation with racial and sexist prejudices — an incident that, though personal, reflects a broader issue pervasive in our workspaces and media today.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The journey reached a pivotal moment at the end-of-year company dinner party, a gathering that marked the culmination of a challenging yet rewarding internship. Having broached the subject of future prospects with my immediate male supervisor during training and discussed my aspirations with colleagues, I felt cautiously optimistic. However, the evening took an unforeseen turn on the ride home, sharing a taxi with a female supervisor who was less often seen during office hours. Her reaction to my shared ambitions was not of encouragement or guidance but one of anger and insinuation. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Frail and Ambiguous Words: How Diplomacy Hinders Peace in Gaza</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/how-diplomacy-hinders-peace-in-gaza/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Words are more than mere vessels of communication; they are potent instruments that can alter the course of history. The recent debate at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), which centred on the choice between ‘cessation’ and ‘suspension’ of hostilities in Gaza, starkly illustrates this power. This debate, far from being a mere matter of semantics, carries profound implications, particularly in terms of human lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As diplomats at the UNSC convened hours before a pivotal vote, they found themselves at a crossroads, their negotiations reaching a fever pitch. The United States, challenging the use of ‘cessation of hostilities’ in &lt;a href=&#34;https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144937&#34;&gt;the draft resolution&lt;/a&gt;, sparked intense diplomatic manoeuvring. The suggested alternative, ‘suspension of hostilities,’ while not finalised, opened a veritable Pandora’s box.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Nevertheless, all said and done, he too is striving for a better world order; the difference is that he is doing it from within: a losing battle, perhaps, but one that is not without its relevance and impact. He has proved to be brave and outspoken and unflinching in his support for the issues that matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She is often shown holding the palm of her martyrdom, which occurred in Syracuse in 304, in one hand, and a saucer containing her eyes in the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This iconographic element is a nod to her role as the protector of sight, although it bears no relation to the martyrdom she endured. The origin of this specific veneration is tied to her name: Lucy, or Lucia, derives from the Latin term &amp;rsquo;lux,&amp;rsquo; meaning light—an element naturally associated with eyesight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Civilisation cannot be achieved without modern infrastructure. In one way or another, there will always be infrastructural failures impacting the development of nations. Can one nation have too much infrastructure? How do nations overbuild themselves to points of sprawling ostentation? The image of the United Nations peacekeeper is routinely overshadowed with powerlessness and melancholic despair.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their purpose is to keep the peace under shaky truces prolonging geopolitical stalemates as things in society go from bad to worse in failed state realities. UN peacekeepers are not builders. They are placeholders with little to no power to influence the restoration of peace. Is it possible to &amp;ldquo;civilianised&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; military power for peaceful purposes in conflict zones steeped in crises?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an era where borders are drawn and redrawn, the quest for a homeland remains fraught with strife for many. Nation-building, the process of constructing a national identity and establishing political and social structures, is pivotal in this quest. It is not just about hotly-debated independence stories or drawing lines on a map; it involves acknowledging diverse histories, cultures and rights to create a cohesive and inclusive society. This is crucial for ensuring peace, stability and progress.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The decision to stop women being able to access school and university by the Taliban in August 2021, has consequently denied millions of girls their fundamental right to education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan has a complex and turbulent history and this has had undeniable consequences on its education system. The department of education was established in Afghanistan in 1913, with the goal of a national education system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nepal&#39;s National Parks: A Conservation Success Shadowed by Local Struggles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Nepal, majestic national parks thrive as sanctuaries for wildlife, but for the local communities who are grappling with human rights abuses the path to harmonious coexistence remains fraught with challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The value of protected spaces like National Parks is undeniable. Nepal&amp;rsquo;s journey with these parks began in 1993, when the Forest Act recognised certain &amp;lsquo;protected forests&amp;rsquo; for their environmental, scientific and cultural value.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once the royal hunting grounds, these spaces have evolved into critical conservation centres, forming a key part of Nepal&amp;rsquo;s forest management strategy. Today, Nepal boasts about 20 such protected spaces. However, while these parks aim for conservation, they also pose challenges, particularly for local communities with restricted access.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whilst the United Nations bats resolutions from one side of the Security Council’s court to another, people are dying in their thousands. This is not the United Nations; this is the Disunited Nations, failing in its primary mission of fostering world peace. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, on October 16, a Russian-sponsored draft text, which had called for an immediate cease-fire, fell through because it did not manage to garner enough votes. Then, on October 18, the US vetoed a Brazilian draft that called for “humanitarian pauses” to allow unhindered humanitarian access. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;India has certainly been in the spotlight these last few months and anyone not looking too closely would be justified in thinking that the country was rising, phoenix-like, from its post-colonial ashes to virtual super power status. In April 2023 it overtook China as the most populous nation on Earth with well over 1.4 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On August 4, Rahul Gandhi, champion of the Congress Party and heir to the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, had his two-year prison sentence for disparaging comments made against Modi, suspended by India’s supreme court, suggesting a robust democratic rule of law. Also in August (23rd), India’s Chandrayaan-3 spacecraft landed on the lunar surface. This was all the more spectacular coming so soon after Russia’s failed moon mission. Moreover, it was the very first successful landing on the dark side of the moon. Then, in September, with much pomp and circumstance, India hosted the 2023 G20 Summit. Its presidency may not have been a roaring success, but it was a success nonetheless. Though Russia’s President Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping did not attend, and organisers had to forego the traditional “family” photo owing to disagreements over Ukraine, the overall outcome was positive, with the African Union’s addition to the block being one of this G20’s notable achievements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Never before has the nexus between sport and international relations been more prominent than in the last 10 years. Even a cursory examination of the world&amp;rsquo;s largest and most publicised sporting events from the last decade reveals a clear link between the games and athletes we love to watch and money, power, and strategic international diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sports-events-reflect-on-a-nations-best-and-worst&#34;&gt;Sports events reflect on a nations&amp;rsquo; best and worst&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Brazil hosted the FIFA World Cup, aiming to exhibit the beauty and rich culture of Brazil. However, the exciting football was overshadowed by extreme poverty; the inequality highlighted by the slums of Rio de Janeiro and the displacement of thousands to accommodate new stadiums.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shrouded in the mystique of the high Himalayas, Tibet presents a realm of stark duality. Its tranquil scenery and the hallowed quietude of temples whisper tales of deep-rooted spirituality. Yet, beneath this cloak of tranquillity, a spirited narrative of national identity and governance grapples with forces of external influence and internal doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The story of Tibet is not solely one of idle meditation; it is equally about active engagement in the arduous task of nation-building. Here, the Dalai Lama stands not only as a spiritual zenith but also as a symbol of the unyielding campaign for cultural and political self-determination. This is a journey into the heart of an aspiring nation, where the pursuit of peace is as much an internal journey as it is a political quest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grief and fury brew a potent concoction for vengeance in the hearts of those who have lost all. The cycle of violence spirals, each rotation taking it to a ghastly new level. Israeli officials, under the banner of ‘self-defence’, have adopted a scorched earth policy towards Gaza. Yet, the international community&amp;rsquo;s reaction often diverges sharply into one of two markedly distinct viewpoints: unflinching support for Israel and utter condemnation for Hamas, or justifying Hamas&amp;rsquo;s targeted killings as acts of legitimate resistance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;nuclear-threats-past-and-present&#34;&gt;Nuclear Threats: Past and Present&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every historical curiosity is borne out of a rhetorical question that challenges the accepted narratives of the past. The history we are taught is often presented as simplified stories with humanity at the existential core. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet, history is actually moulded by successive generations. With Vladimir Putin ordering Russia&amp;rsquo;s Strategic Rocket Forces to perform battle readiness drills with live nuclear weapons on Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s border, the spectre of nuclear war has returned in a starkly real manner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As October’s chill sets in, ‘The Gordian’ returns from its brief hiatus with a meticulously curated issue titled ‘Global Constitution: The New Social Contract.’ This edition seeks to weave together the intricate threads of geopolitics, art, culture, and science, presenting a cohesive narrative of our shared global destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In ‘&lt;em&gt;The Imagined Unity&lt;/em&gt;: Understanding Nations, Nationalism and Their Bedrock,’ Alexander Stoney offers an exploration of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/nations-nationalism-and-their-bedrock/&#34;&gt;nuanced concept of ‘Nation’.&lt;/a&gt; This sets the stage for Adrian Liberto’s discourse on the pressing need for a global constitution in &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-global-constitution-and-why-we-need-it/&#34;&gt;‘&lt;em&gt;The Global Constitution: And Why we Need it&lt;/em&gt;.’&lt;/a&gt; Liberto subsequently scrutinises the UN’s role in the Palestinian crisis in &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/un-in-focus/palestine-and-794-letters-to-unsc/&#34;&gt;‘Palestine and the UN: Will this 794th letter jolt the Security Council into action?’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few terms in political science hold as complex a definition as “Nation”. As UN-aligned launches its new volume of The Gordian, exploring Nation Building, it becomes crucial to establish a clear understanding of the term and its multilayered complexities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-nation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a nation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A nation is defined as “a group of people who share a history, traditions, culture and, often, language – even if the group does not have a country of its own”, writes National Geographic. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#39;Transcending Strokes&#39;: Caravaggio&#39;s Unmistakable Emotion in &#34;Judith and Holofernes&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The repetition of distinctive stylistic elements helps art scholars, when necessary, to identify and recognise the authors. In the case of Caravaggio, the most frequent distinctive elements are different: the stroke of the drawing; the choice of the same models for the various characters; the way of interpreting the colours; the contrast between shadow and light…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet what in my eyes makes Caravaggio&amp;rsquo;s hand truly unmistakable, even more than the presence of these objective stylistic elements, is the emotional tension that shines through the faces of the characters who, in most cases, tell us about the eternal conflict between good and evil that has always accompanied man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Selective Outrage of the Tories: HS2 and Beyond</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Rishi Sunak&amp;rsquo;s decision to axe the Birmingham to Manchester segment, packaged as a pragmatic financial choice, has ruffled feathers, not least those of former prime ministers &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/1709579002220867922&#34;&gt;David Cameron&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tiktok.com/@dailymailuk/video/7284266548674563361&#34;&gt;Boris Johnson&lt;/a&gt;. Their collective critique, given their individual and joint legacies, is nothing short of ironic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sunak, in his &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/10/4/uk-tory-conference-live-news-rishi-sunak-to-address-hs2-controversy&#34;&gt;address to the Conservative party&amp;rsquo;s annual rally&lt;/a&gt;, positioned himself as a radical reformer. His vision of axing HS2&amp;rsquo;s northern leg, introducing a broader Advanced British Standard to replace A-levels, and incrementally banning smoking are audacious moves. Yet, one cannot help but see these as emblematic of the Tories&amp;rsquo; recurring approach: prioritising headline-grabbing policies while seemingly neglecting dire issues such as child poverty, housing and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 22, 2023, Riyad H. Mansour, the Palestinian-American diplomat who has been the Permanent Observer of Palestine to the United Nations since 2005, wrote a letter, his 794th, to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was triggered by the recent atrocities in Jenin. The letter, addressed to the Secretary-General, the President of the General Assembly and the President of the Security Council, highlighted the crimes committed by Israel against the Palestinian people. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, has signed an Anti-Homosexuality Act (AHA), outlawing homosexuality in the country. Uganda&amp;rsquo;s penal code already prohibits same-sex conduct, but the new bill, signed on the 26th of May, introduced the death penalty for acts classified as “aggravated homosexuality”, which includes spreading HIV, rape and serial offending. Moreover, it raised the imprisonment term for same-sex conduct to 10 years, while a 20-year sentence could be handed to anyone promoting homosexuality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Armenia’s ICC Pivot: Defying Russia and Eyeing European and Iranian Ties</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an unprecedented development, Armenian lawmakers have ratified the Rome Statute, thereby signifying the nation&amp;rsquo;s intent to join the International Criminal Court (ICC).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This development has sent ripples all the way to the Kremlin, which seems less than pleased. Given the earlier move by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/icc-pursues-putin-and-lvova-belova/&#34;&gt;ICC to issue an arrest warrant for Russian President&lt;/a&gt; Vladimir Putin in March, Armenia now finds itself on a tightrope, precariously balancing its long-standing alliance with Russia. This recent gesture by Armenia has not only added a strain to its delicate camaraderie with Russia but also hints at a cautious pivot towards the West for a security umbrella. &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-icj-the-icc-whose-justice/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The whirling hum of the spinning wheel, the rhythm of skilled hands modelling shapeless clay and the mesmerising transformation in the kiln: the world of pottery is one of patience, resilience and creativity. And within this sphere in Iran, two exceptional women, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/samirghafori/?img_index=1&#34;&gt;Samira Ghafori&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/anna_clayart/?img_index=1&#34;&gt;Anahita Ahmadi,&lt;/a&gt; are shaping more than just clay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Samira, an artist who started young, had her destiny intertwined with pottery before she even knew it. Her early fascination with the craft was born out of playful experimentation that evolved into a lifelong commitment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Located in the northern region of the Indian subcontinent, at the base of the Himalayan Mountains, lies the country of Nepal. A place rich in cultural and natural diversity, Nepal&amp;rsquo;s vibrant history intertwines with the lives of its Dalit citizens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dalit communities in South Asian countries like India and Nepal endure persistent marginalisation, exclusion and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nationalgeographic.com/pages/article/indias-untouchables-face-violence-discrimination&#34;&gt;human rights violations&lt;/a&gt;. They live in constant apprehension of public humiliation, assault and abuse, with upper-caste groups frequently using violence as a means to maintain societal hierarchies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On June 7th, 2023, after an extensive visit and tour of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), senior UN official Jean-Pierre Lacroix spoke to reporters in the country’s capital, Kinshasa. The line of questioning was centered entirely around the UN’s 24-year long peacekeeping mission, known as MONUSCO. His response to these questions was brief, yet it made headlines globally: the peacekeepers &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rfi.fr/en/africa/20230609-un-peacekeeping-mission-in-drc-is-to-withdraw-as-quickly-as-possible&#34;&gt;should withdraw&lt;/a&gt; from the conflict-torn country “as quickly as possible”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;first-contact&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First Contact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Isaac Newton famously said: “If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” Sadly, society is where it is today because most people have stood on the shoulders of ogres. The past sticks to us like shit on a shoe and we have become so accustomed to the foul smell, that rather than scrape off the dung, we wallow in it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picture this: planet earth in the 21st century, but one that had never witnessed the advent of humankind. Then, suddenly, it is discovered by an alien species much like our own. Before long, the planet is plundered, ravaged and abused. Life forms are enslaved, tortured and killed for entertainment, fashion and culinary delights, their habitats destroyed; forests are cut down; and rivers and seas polluted beyond recognition, as are the skies. Finally, having exhausted every possible resource, the alien species moves on, like a plague of locusts, to its next quarry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Life in a refugee camp seems stuck in an unending cycle of sameness. Days blur into one another, the only change being the unpredictable and often unforgiving weather conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an attempt to document the individual days, but the repetition of the mundane is all too clear. Every harsh, cold morning feels identical, showing no mercy to the inhabitants. The only source of warmth is the resilience of the human spirit, akin to the skeletal structure of a body that refuses to succumb.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Could the development of robots capable of demining, ensure that peace is within reach for regions recovering from or living through conflict?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest escapes for children growing up against the backdrop of war and famine is in their creative imaginations. The power of pretend is brilliantly articulated by children in games where they explore and adventure in the unforgiving rubble and debris of their war-torn communities. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imagine, a child wanders to the outskirts of town kicking stone pebbles in between barbed wiring, intermittingly dispersed in a seemingly unsuspecting demarcation area alluding to some kind of Neverland. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Behold the curious tale of Boris Johnson, a leader whose exit from the political limelight has been less of a dignified adieu and more of a truculent retreat. Clad in the armour of self-pity, Johnson seems to have recast himself as a tragic hero, wronged by an ‘ungrateful nation’. However, as the curtains close, the audience sees through the artifice, observing a man who, in the throes of responsibility, chose subterfuge over substance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Most are undoubtedly familiar with this feeling of intense frustration at the sight of a small fine tucked at the base of their windshield.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, what if a minor parking ticket posed the threat of a much larger consequence? What if it meant your children would be taken out of school? What if it meant you and your family could be deported? This is the reality for thousands of illegal immigrant families living in North America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Climate change continues to wreak havoc across Africa, raising questions about preparedness and resilience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;South Kivu Province in DR Congo Ravaged by Torrential Rains&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On May 4th, 2023, the South Kivu province of DR Congo was brought to its knees as torrential rains swept away villages and killed hundreds of people. The DR Congo government is grappling with disaster response and reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;post-war-english-literature&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-War English Literature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As we have already seen while analysing the literary background of previous periods, the literature of each historical age often reflected the political and social situation of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Post World War II literature was no different. Those terrible years of violence and devastation created a sense of general pessimism, cynicism and disillusionment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Literature after the Second World War clearly portrayed man&amp;rsquo;s disorientation, which was not only evident in the content of literary works but also characterised by the absence of one specific major school of thought or movement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Corruption is paid by the poor,&amp;rdquo; warns Pope Francis, highlighting an unsettling reality: those least able to afford it, endure corruption&amp;rsquo;s harshest consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The publication of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022&#34;&gt;Corruption Perceptions Index&lt;/a&gt; 2022 (CPI), which uses a scale from 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean), has shed light on the efforts taken by policymakers to combat corruption in different countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The report indicates that out of the 180 countries assessed, 124 have made no progress in fighting corruption across any levels. This staggering statistic underscores the severity and pervasiveness of the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Love for Erdogan&#39;s Autocracy in the Heart of German Democracy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recep Tayyip Erdogan&amp;rsquo;s name echoes in Istanbul and Berlin alike. As Turkey&amp;rsquo;s President, he commands attention and drives conversation in both these distinct locales, exerting an influence that, to many observers, seems paradoxical. Despite being in the heart of Europe, where democracy is a foundational value, Erdogan&amp;rsquo;s autocratic approach finds a surprisingly receptive audience within a substantial German-Turkish community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Erdogan&amp;rsquo;s influence over this diaspora often equals, and at times even outstrips, his hold over his own nation, a conundrum that pushes against traditional ideas about the strength of democracy. But how can an autocratic leader secure such steadfast loyalty from a community residing in one of the world&amp;rsquo;s most solid democracies?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My fixation with Caravaggio is one that prompts me to continually seek avenues to discuss his work. The necessity to scrutinise the Crucifixion of St. Peter, residing in the Cerasi Chapel, provides a convenient pretext. This painting, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-conversion-of-st-paul-by-caravaggio-a-masterpiece-of-dramatic-intensity-and-transformative-power/&#34;&gt;the Conversion of St. Paul,&lt;/a&gt; was crafted for the same patron.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the underlying motivation is less about circumstance and more about an earnest fascination with Caravaggio&amp;rsquo;s life and artistic creations, even though the root of this allure remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Beneath the surface of our greedy economy lies a lurking danger, driven by the relentless greed of giant oil companies. Like the ominous entrance to Dante&amp;rsquo;s Inferno, their self-serving position and inaction threaten to unleash chaos and destruction. However, before shedding light on hidden environmental and ethical transgressions across scattered timelines, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about the lethal nature of the oil giants&amp;rsquo; self-serving stance and their culpability for inaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;barring-the-gates&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barring the gates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All art aficionados would be familiar with Rodin’s The Thinker, or representations of it, some may have even been lucky enough to see the pensive figure in his intended setting sitting atop of The Gates of Hell. Whatever was he thinking? My guess is that he was contemplating what Sartre put into words decades later: &amp;ldquo;L&amp;rsquo;enfer, c&amp;rsquo;est les autres&amp;rdquo; (Hell is other people).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;American composer Michael Torke has once again delivered an album that showcases his unique voice and style, drawing inspiration from jazz and minimalism to create a work that shimmers with vibrant timbrel palettes and infectious energy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finished in 2019, “Being” is a continuous 43-minute composition that consists of nine parts, each building on the previous and creating a hypnotic and immersive experience for the listener.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before talking about the music, we need to talk about the elephant in the room – that album cover. It looks like someone typed in “women holding coffee staring into the abyss” on a stock photo website and called it a day. But don&amp;rsquo;t let the questionable art direction deter you, the music inside is worth every quid.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Could Wilson&amp;rsquo;s vision for the US National Park Service inspire a UN World Park Service? This global agency, dedicated to preserving ecological and historic sites, could promote international cooperation, environmental conservation, and the collective appreciation of our cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;modern-internationalism-with-wilsonian-idealism&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modern Internationalism with Wilsonian Idealism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Woodrow Wilson left behind a legacy of would-be idealism most aptly characterised by his Fourteen Points speech he delivered before the United States Congress on January 8th, 1918. The end of World War I would arrive ten months later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the effects of climate change continue to worsen, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to explore innovative engineering solutions that can help us mitigate these impacts. This article delves into four groundbreaking engineering solutions that are providing hope for a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel-based power generation, transportation, industrial processes, and the like, are exacerbating the process of global warming. To restrict the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees centigrade by 2100, it is essential to adopt engineering solutions that can aid in reducing this warming effect.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the adage goes, “truth is stranger than fiction”. Case in point: Russia, the very nation embroiled in a relentless war in Ukraine, has assumed the presidency of the UN Security Council, an institution dedicated to preserving global peace and security.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To add to the absurdity, Russia&amp;rsquo;s top dog, Vladimir Putin, has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/icc-pursues-putin-and-lvova-belova/&#34;&gt;slapped with an arrest warrant&lt;/a&gt; by the ICC for his role in abducting Ukrainian children. As we try to make sense of this bizarre twist of fate, one can&amp;rsquo;t help but wonder if this is an elaborate April Fools&amp;rsquo; ruse, leaving Ukraine&amp;rsquo;s UN mission and countless others befuddled and aghast.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

She &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2023/02/16/putins-childrens-envoy-reveals-she-adopted-child-from-mariupol-a80249&#34;&gt;expressed gratitude to Putin&lt;/a&gt; for enabling the “adoption” of a young boy from Mariupol, unwittingly revealing the chilling reality of Ukrainian children torn from their homes and subjected to “re-education camps” or forced adoptions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Russia’s permanent seat on the UN Security Council is under scrutiny like never. What would happen if the UN decided to expel this rogue state from the Security Council? Will it lead to war, polarisation, or perhaps a new beginning for the UN?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;About a year ago now, on 7 April 2022, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution triggering the suspension of Russia from the Human Rights Council. Oh, would it not be lovely if it could also be suspended from its status as a permanent member of the Security Council! But first things first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Change can happen by deliberate choice or can be brought about unexpectedly by life&amp;rsquo;s unpredictable events, which often add new shades and dimensions to our existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The Angry Young Men were not only novelists but also playwrights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look Back in Anger by John Osborne was certainly the turning point of British drama. The main character, Jimmy Porter, an intellectual who had to work in the market-place to support his family, represented that new kind of dissatisfaction and rage. He, in fact, was rejected by society and subsequently turned against it with indiscriminate fury.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 4th 2023, Dubai announced an 8.7 trillion-dollar expansion plan as a part of its diversification plan to shift its focus from revenues generated from oil reserves. The emirate aspires to become a global financial hub by boosting its manufacturing and logistics, making it an attractive proposition for foreign investors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vision 2030&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is another diversification strategy under the leadership of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to reduce its dependence on hydrocarbons. The government estimates it can raise 1 trillion riyals in non-governmental revenue and decrease the unemployment rate from 12% to 7% by 2030. Qatar also positions itself to be one of the emerging investment destinations by implementing the policies from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gco.gov.qa/en/about-qatar/national-vision2030/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Qatar National Vision 2030&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The chances are, it was generated by an AI using a trendy new app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lensa is just one of many apps that have recently gained popularity, allowing users to generate portraits, illustrations and other types of artwork at the click of a button. But while these AI-powered tools can produce impressive results, they have also sparked a debate about the implications of using AI to create art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That&amp;rsquo;s where the concept of a bioeconomy comes in. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By harnessing renewable resources, a bioeconomy has the potential to not only help mitigate emissions, but also support communities that have been historically marginalised, such as forest dwellers, farmers and indigenous populations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in order to fully realise the benefits of a bioeconomy, we need to ensure that it is supported by smart policies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

As a refugee myself, I now want to share one last story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I met a 23-year-old returning from work in the stone sawmills with his clothes covered in dust. He was the son of our neighbour and one of the brightest students at his university. He was forced to leave school due to forced majeure and ended up supporting his family by working in the mills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As an old millennial having experienced childhood in the nineties, my generation grew up with the quintessential strongmen movies personified in protagonists like Rocky Balboa, Ivan Drago and Apollo Creed, as seen in the Rocky franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In Rocky 4, Dolph Lundgren portrayed a rather intimidating antihero; an opponent more machine than man. My generation remembers a world before it was possible to Google our curiosities away into the ether of the internet. Exposure to the world in terms of different cultures, languages and ways of life was primarily derived from movies like Rocky 4. Ivan Drago, Rocky&amp;rsquo;s deadly opponent having killed Apollo Creed in the boxing ring, seemingly revisited the literal definition of the New Soviet Man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is in desperate need of reform. Its current structure and its voting system have failed to effectively address global conflicts and address the needs of its member states.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The council, made up of 15 members, including the five permanent members or P5 (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States) who hold unbridled veto power, has remained largely unchanged since its creation in 1945.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Redefining our modern self-serving economics to eradicate poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reality is what keeps us safe. It informed our past and it guides our present. Reality is our safe zone. It is the anchor on which our boat is secured. It is the devil we know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, as anyone who has owned a boat can tell you, a tight anchor is the surest way to sink your boat: a change in tide, a swell… and without the leeway in your rope, you are underwater.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On January 25, UNESCO inscribed the historical Ukrainian city of Odessa on the World Heritage List and the World Heritage in Danger List. “Odessa, a free city, a world city, a legendary port that has left its mark on cinema, literature and the arts, is thus placed under the reinforced protection of the international community,” said Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The people of the port city were delighted as was its mayor, Gennady Trukhanov. He pointed out, however, that the task would not be an easy one:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ostriches are said to bury their heads in the sand to avoid facing the facts, politicians bury theirs in the dung of deliberate ignorance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On December 30, the United Nations General Assembly held a vote on whether to submit a request to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for an advisory opinion on the consequences of the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Ecc6TPEIckuW0z-5e-BYtexjnhxoaXq7ursfLHGT830UC-MTfpqLrVwUikHznQEh5ih-Afp4q7LRGm3DZIazGqG9rofPXMaTFtHDZxS84rClG-yKBCe8n0tOCUztO87TlLy68GmtqLdSeSVEXJd-zzU&#34; alt=&#34;UNGA votes on the Israel&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UNGA voted on the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. 87 in favour, 26 Against and 53 Abstentions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The state of Arizona has been a hotspot for immigrants for many years. The US state, which shares about 600 km of border with Mexico, has become a popular destination for refugees and migrants who escape their homes searching for a better and safer life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While some advocate for mass deportations of these ‘illegal immigrants’, others argue for faster processing and greater protections for those seeking asylum or other forms of humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenging conditions of the deep sea, life thrives in this surreal world. The pressure can be unfathomable, temperatures can plummet to subzero, and darkness is all-consuming, yet a vast array of life forms, ranging from bioluminescent jellyfish to colossal squids, showcase exquisite diversity and beauty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The deep sea is an enigmatic and mesmerising environment that never ceases to amaze us with its extraordinary inhabitants. Join us as we embark on an extraordinary expedition to the unfamiliar, as we unravel the wonders of the deep sea and the creatures that inhabit it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In last month’s issue we surveyed the two literary genres of poetry and the novel at the turn of the 20th century which we defined as &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/how-the-age-of-self-discovery-changed-the-english-poetry-and-the-novel-forever/&#34;&gt;an Age of Self-Discovery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We saw how the tide began to change during the last two decades of Queen Victoria’s reign, when some writers sought a newer and fresher approach to literature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We then surveyed the literature that developed with the onset of the First World War, which had triggered in man the awareness to see life as an abyss of incessant self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>4 Ways to Combat the Negative Impacts of Global Warming on Biodiversity</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The contemporary phenomena of global warming has created a &amp;ldquo;Hothouse Earth&amp;rdquo; and has wreaked havoc on pristine ecosystems. The melting of glaciers exposes vast swathes of marine water to atmospheric carbon dioxide, lowering pH from alkaline values and threatening the survival of corals and other marine organisms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the indiscriminate felling of certain species of flora and the poaching of certain species of animals for medicinal purposes exacerbates their extinction. Clearing tropical rainforests for agriculture also strips the planet of its carbon sinks and lungs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Remember when you and Akka [older sister in Tamil] used to skip dance class by hiding in the storage shed in the backyard?”, reminisces my Aunt. “We would spend ages looking for you, thinking you both had gone missing.” It’s been 13 years since the end of the Sri Lankan civil war and my cousin went missing. My aunt, like many mothers in Sri Lanka, is still searching for her daughter or at least answers as to what happened to her. Answers she is unlikely to ever find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;American award-winning actress, film director, producer, and humanitarian, Angelina Jolie, has decided to quit her role as a Special Envoy to the United Nations refugee agency, the UNHCR, citing a desire to “work differently”. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Jolie has worked with the UNHCR since 2001, and has been a Special Envoy for the organisation since 2012. Her role involved building awareness and support for refugees and highlighting the need for urgent action to be taken in order to tackle issues relating to the serious events that force people to flee their homes, such as conflict and climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a decision that is being celebrated as a victory for women’s rights, the UN’s Economic and Social Council has removed Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW). The country’s tenure, meant to last until 2026, was cut short in response to Iran’s repeated violations against the rights of women, including the violent suppression of protests demanding justice for the death of &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/zahhak-to-iran-has-ferdowsi-prophesied-the-future-of-the-republic/&#34;&gt;Mahsa Amini&lt;/a&gt;, a young woman who died in police custody last September.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the greatest impediment to world peace is the United Nations Security Council itself. This is felt by the power of the mighty veto held by each of the five permanent members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The image of the Security Council is that of a &amp;ldquo;club of superpowers&amp;rdquo; each prioritising its own national interests over the other. In the rule of the jungle, realities of realpolitik assume total precedence where &amp;ldquo;might is right decision theory&amp;rdquo; rules supremely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It was 11 April, 1992. Neil Kinnock and his Labour Party were set to win the general election and the best the Conservatives could have hoped for was a hung parliament. Then, however, The Sun, one of the UK&amp;rsquo;s right wing tabloid newspapers owned by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch, launched an aggressive campaign to swing things around&amp;hellip; and sure enough it did.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government&amp;rsquo;s treatment of workers and Unions asking for a fair pay rise during a cost of living crisis has been shameful. Nurses, ambulance drivers, paramedics, and other frontline workers have been demonised and blamed for the country&amp;rsquo;s economic woes, despite their tireless efforts to keep the country running during a global crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, those who have actually caused the economic damage – such as the former prime minister who blew a £30 billion hole in the economy overnight, the shambolic execution of Brexit that is estimated to have cost the country over £40 billion, the Tory government’s botched test and trace programme which costed £37 billion, their wasteful procurement of PPE resulting in £8.7 billion being wasted and ending up in the pockets of Tory donors and Richie Sunak’s decision to spend £11 billion by overpaying interest on UK debt – are allowed to escape accountability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years immigration has been a controversial subject in the US. Some Americans call for harsher policies against immigration, others for a revision of immigration policies to allow for easier processing and more assistance to refugees. All in all, one after the other, governments have tried to revise these policies in hopes of appeasing the American population, but neither has been able to fully address this issue in a manner favourable to all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After two devastating world wars, the prospect of &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pugwash.org/1955/07/09/statement-manifesto/&#34;&gt;universal death&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rdquo; was on everyone&amp;rsquo;s mind. It was time for global institutions to ensure genuine world peace. The United Nations was &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.un.org/en/about-us/un-charter/preamble&#34;&gt;formed&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ldquo;to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its mission statement reflected the deep desire of war-ravaged humankind to put an end to international violence once and for all. Yet even before the foundation of the UN, activists and scholars had warned about the UN Charter&amp;rsquo;s design flaws. The criticism of the UN structure has lost nothing in relevance to this day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Scandal-engulfed President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is being investigated for serious violations and misconduct, survived a vote in parliament which could have set in motion impeachment proceedings that could have forced him out of office.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;18.12.22: &lt;strong&gt;Tunisia&lt;/strong&gt;. The electorate has given President Kais Saied a clear message by boycotting yesterday’s elections, with less than 9% turning up to vote. The President had suspended parliament on March 30, 2022 and revised the constitution in the hope that he could cling to power, a prospect that has now become more unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In a world that moves at a dizzying speed, UN-aligned and The Gordian have stayed true to their values, fighting for a better UN and bringing our readers the insights and information they need to stay informed and engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As the editor of &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/the-gordian/&#34;&gt;The Gordian magazine,&lt;/a&gt; I reflect upon the past year with both gratitude and concern. On the one hand, I am grateful for the dedication and hard work of our team, whose members have produced high-quality, fact-based, impactful journalism that has provided clarity and imagination in an unprecedented year. On the other hand, I am concerned about the numerous challenges and crises that have impacted our world in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of Giovanni Paolo Pietrobattista, although chronologically distant, are incredibly close, because their protagonist was my great uncle. Despite never having met Giovanni Paolol, he is very dear to me thanks to the stories my grandmother and my father have shared with me. Nor only have they instilled in me admiration for what my uncle had been able to achieve, but also a strong affection and empathy towards him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What can the movement for a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly takeaway from the World Development Index? According to the United Nations Surviving on Pennies Global Awareness Initiative, 1 billion people live on $1.00 daily. We have been trained to localize the concept of gross domestic product by national classification, but on average, how widely considered as the world&amp;rsquo;s gross domestic product per capita?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of 2021, Macrotrends reported &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/WLD/world/gdp-gross-domestic-product&#34;&gt;the world GDP&lt;/a&gt; at a meager $11,407 (per capita), less than what the United States Assistant Office of Planning &amp;amp; Evaluation identified as poverty for one person at $12,880 for the same year.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Literature during the Victorian Era identified itself with the ethical values of that society. The superficial optimism and bigotry of a self-righteous attitude forged a kind of literature that was condescending and emotionally wanting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apart from the few exceptions like Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights, most of the production of that period lacked the emotional intensity or the daring experimentation of writers belonging to other periods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tide began to change during the last two decades of Victoria’s reign, when some writers sought a newer and fresher approach to literature.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When the United Nations is not busy declaring French baguette a world cultural heritage or hosting awkward diplomatic cocktail parties where everyone pretends to like each other&amp;rsquo;s national dishes, it dedicates a small portion of its resources to protecting human rights across the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in November, a fact-finding investigation into human rights violations in Iran, where hundreds have died and tens of thousands have been detained since protests started in September 2022, has been approved by the UN Human Rights Council.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many international organisations have warned about the worsening situation in Haiti, but some members of the United Nations were set on keeping the aid package to Haiti strictly humanitarian stating that they would let the Haitians solve their own political issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, in the face of the growing threat to peace and security due to gang-related violence, hunger and an infrastructure crisis caused by several natural disasters, as well as the lack of proper medical equipment and personnel in response to the needs of the Haitian population amid several health emergencies such as the cholera outbreak, on October 21, 2022, the UN Security Council unanimously voted to establish a sanctions regime on Haiti to punish the actors responsible or complicit in actions that threaten peace, security, and financial stability in the region.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to its charter, the UN was created to maintain international peace and security, protect human rights, deliver humanitarian aid, and support sustainable development. Each of these is an honourable goal that is sometimes brought to fruition in parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;193 countries around the globe are members of the United Nations and among those are the P5 (permanent Security Council Members) chosen because of their importance in the aftermath of WWII. Each one of these countries is part of the UN because they claim to believe in what this organisation stands for.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago, I wrote an article for The Gordian Magazine celebrating the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/lifestyle/women-football-not-brave-enough-to-see-the-vision/&#34;&gt;growth of women’s football&lt;/a&gt; in the UK, and hailing 2022 as a watershed year in women’s sport around the world. Now, just a few months later, nothing seems further from the truth. In choosing to host one of the world’s biggest sporting competitions in Qatar this year, a country run on Sharia law and plagued by inequalities, FIFA has let the world know that football remains the domain of straight men.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last few issues of The Gordian, we have covered various aspects of justice, from the definition of justice itself to specific instances regarding the assaults it is often subject to. In order to understand justice from a legal perspective, however, it is important to bear in mind the various aspects that are involved in law enforcement. Here are some important points to bear in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Ensuring ethical, global, flexible and measured definitions of criminal acts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Technology helps us improve our lives and make things easier. However, there are two sides to everything. Undoubtedly, for instance, Artificial Intelligence will grow further, but I am sure it has both a positive and a negative impact on the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me be honest, when technology just started to enter our lives in the early 90’s in India I was super thrilled with it. I was fascinated with the pagers and then the mobiles in the late 90’s and I liked the fact that at the press of a button I could reach my near and dear ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dante Alighieri&#39;s Vision for World Government: The Pathway to Abolishing War</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dante&amp;rsquo;s death 700 years ago marked the end of an era. But his lasting legacy may be his vision for a world government, outlined in his work De Monarchia. Written in 1313, this work may be the first literature to present a comprehensive solution to the problem of war.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult to imagine any sort of connection between the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, and something that occurred in an unremarkable bedroom in Italy almost exactly 700 years prior. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the deep historical connections between Russia and Ukraine, at many times one and the same state, during the preceding seven centuries. But last autumn marked the 700th anniversary of the death of the great Italian poet Dante Alighieri, from malaria, in Ravenna, on September 14, 1321. His bones lie there still.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Her blindfold is supposed to symbolise impartiality, however, one cannot help comparing the blindfold to that of “blind” Fortune, whose largess is purely random. How else can there be so much injustice in the world? We said no more and introduced our readers to a new Lady Justice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-human-tragedy&#34;&gt;A human tragedy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Victims of the cholera outbreak have now been reported in more than 29 countries including Kenya, Somalia, RDC, Haiti, Syria, and Lebanon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of numerous issues plaguing Syrians, the outbreak of cholera and the start of winter all chip away at the already thinning resources in the region. It is reported that more than 14.6 million people there need assistance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UNICEF has appealed for $27.5 million to help combat the spread of cholera in Haiti, where roughly 40% of confirmed cases are children.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Gordian rolls on with its messages of peace and light and respect, but notwithstanding, the world seems to be getting darker and more troubled. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Climate disasters are no longer the exception, while the threat of a nuclear apocalypse is more real than it ever has been. Giving in is not an option. On the contrary we must double our efforts to combat all that is a threat to the dignity and wellbeing of humanity and the survival of earth’s multifaceted manifestations of nature. Being marginally involved with organisations like UN-aligned is no longer enough. Each and every one of us needs to do more, both as individuals and as part of our communities, be they local, or global like UN-aligned. For want of a nail the shoe was lost… then the horse, the rider, the message, the battle and finally, the kingdom. We are that nail, but we have been led to believe that our input is insignificant. It isn’t. So The Gordian will continue to roll on with your support and inspiration: a platform for the sharing of ideas and information and a launchpad for exiting ventures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>David Herbert Lawrence: The Freudian who hated industrialisation</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/culture/david-herbert-lawrence-the-freudian-who-hated-industrialisation/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/culture/david-herbert-lawrence-the-freudian-who-hated-industrialisation/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;early-life&#34;&gt;Early Life&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;David Herbert Lawrence was born on the 11th September 1885 at Eastwood, a poor small mining town near Nottingham. He was the fourth of five children. His father was an uneducated collier who was fond of drinking and having a good time. His mother, on the contrary, was a well-educated retired teacher whose determination and puritanical strength of character greatly influenced her son&amp;rsquo;s psyche. The social difference between D.H. Lawrence&amp;rsquo;s parents was the major cause of the endless quarrels and rows that used to take place in the Lawrence family.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each of us is constantly torn between comfortable facade truths, and those deep and real truths that sometimes elude us. For most people, it is relatively easy to keep the uncomfortable aspects of authentic truths hidden. In the case of artists, on the other hand, especially the best known ones, this secrecy is lost because their lives, and their works, are often under the lens of historical and stylistic research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Strategies for achieving decarbonisation in consonance with energy security</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Energy is one of the inalienable stanchions of modern human-social-industrial life. The current global temperature is 1.1 degree centigrade above pre-industrial levels. The recent devastating events like increase in glacial lake outburst floods,  droughts , cyclones, forest fires, and the like could be attributed to the rising global temperatures. As the pernicious effects of global warming are now no longer covert, it is high time to resort to decarbonisation using a combination of efficient technologies and carbon dioxide sequestration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Like many people who love their companion animals, it may be surprising how so many animals wind up in shelters unclaimed, says Jill Tucker, CEO of California Animal Welfare Association&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tucker, who originally started her career in software, shifted into the animal sector in 2003, where she moved from California to Vermont to run an animal humane society organisation. From starting as a foster parent to making her way as the president of that same organisation, Tucker found herself as a leader in protecting animals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/demilitarising-the-manipulable-atom/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When World War One broke out, one of the founding fathers of modern science fiction, H.G. Wells, popularised the &amp;ldquo;war to end all wars&amp;rdquo; antiwar euphemism while trenches were dug on the Western front as British, French and German militaries mobilised for war. That same euphemism is often adopted and overused by aggressive unilateralists bent on justifying wanton militarism in pursuit of lopsided geopolitical objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What Wells juxtaposed as the seminal foundation for a future liberated from the scourge of war, the Serbian American inventor Nikola Tesla fashioned in the form of a &amp;ldquo;death ray&amp;rdquo; to deny the possibility of war by vaporising invading militaries with &amp;ldquo;national energy shields&amp;rdquo; powered by alternating current. If history has proved anything, it is that war is one of man&amp;rsquo;s seminal preoccupations. War colleges churning out young military officers would have us believe wars are justifiable if waged to restore order to a Westphalian international balance of power system to make world peace possible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is the World Atomic Weapons Disarmament Agency (WAWDA) and why do we need it</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/un-in-focus/the-need-for-a-world-atomic-weapons-disarmament-agency/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Atomic Energy Agency was established on July 29th, 1957, to relegate atomic energy exploits for peaceful purposes. The idea was to deny the militarization of atomic weapons, but how successful has the same agency been in working toward a future free of nuclear weapons?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Russia&amp;rsquo;s unilateralist war in Ukraine was a rude awakening as fears of nuclear war returned to the public discourse. Unfortunately, we live in a reality where not every concerned world citizen is also a world federalist. This is most evident in national societies inhibited by limited free assembly. In controlled societies where official state discourse assumes supreme precedence over the individual discourse of citizens, disconnects in communicating the mission of world federalism will remain a tremendous challenge for global audiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“When I see all my kingsmen, Krishna, who have come here on this field of battle, life goes from my limbs and they sink, and my mouth is sear and dry; a trembling overcomes my body, and my hair shudders in horror. My great bow, Gandiva, falls from my hands and the skin of my flesh is burning; I am no longer able to stand, because my mind is whirling and wondering. And I see forebodings of evil, Krishna. I cannot foresee any glory if I kill my own kinsmen in the sacrifice of battle. Because I have no wish for victory, Krishna, nor for kingdom, nor for its pleasures. How can we want a kingdom, Govinda, or its pleasures or even life, when those for whom we want a kingdom and its pleasures, and the joys of life are here in this field of battle, giving up their wealth and their life?” (Translation by Juan Mascaró)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From Zahhak to the Islamic Republic of Iran: Has Ferdowsi prophesied the future of the republic?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zahhak was the evil king of Mesopotamia who conquered Iran and, together with his army and serpents that grew out of his two shoulders, terrorised the people of the land for thousands of years. It all started when in order to congratulate the new king on his new position, the embodiment of evil, known in the Book of Kings as Ahriman, disguises himself as the royal cook and asks to kiss the new king’s shoulders. Zahhak agrees and moments after Ahriman’s lips touch Zahhak’s shoulders two black snakes emerge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;ingredients&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; 4 cups (946.35 ml) of peeled sliced peaches&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; ½ cup (118.3 ml)  of water&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; 2 cups (473.17 ml) of organic sugar&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; 1 ½ cups (354.88 ml) of self-rising flour (must be self-rising!)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; 1 ½ cups (354.88 ml) of almond milk&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;1 stick (8 tbsp) vegan butter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;ground cinnamon &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Suggested toppings: vegan vanilla ice cream&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-make-it&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to make it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Heat oven to 350°F /176 °C/gas 4 and let warm up while prepping the cobbler.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Place a medium (3Q) saucepan on the stove and set the heat to medium. Pour peaches, water, and 1 cup (236.59 ml) of sugar into the pan and mix. Let heat for about 10 minutes and mix occasionally. Set aside when done. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take out another medium mixing bowl. Pour in self-rising flour and 1 cup (236.59 ml) sugar and mix. Next, pour in almond milk and mix together. Set bowl aside. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Take 1 stick ( 8 tbsp) of butter and heat until soft (Do not melt entirely!). Take soft butter and spread it into a 9x9 glass baking dish. Take the mixture from the bowl and pour it evenly into the dish. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Next, take the peaches from the pan and drain the water. Using a spoon, evenly spread peaches over the mixture in the dish. Then, take a generous amount of cinnamon and sprinkle it over top of the cobbler. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt; Place cobbler into the oven and bake for approx. 45-50 minutes. Timing may vary. Take the cobbler out of the oven and set it aside to cool down for about 5-10 minutes. Serve with vegan vanilla ice cream and enjoy!&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tip: To check if the mixture is baked to your liking, take the pan out of the oven. Take a fork or knife and poke into the mixture. If a bit of mixture is still left on the utensil, feel free to bake the cobbler for another 10 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Disclaimer: The recipe was made with non-organic sugar. In order to be a completely vegan recipe, be sure to use organic sugar. Timing may vary based on this change.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear reader, &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your great and timely question. Antonio Guterres recently called for “sending to the past” nuclear weapons and has said that the “world must abandon them forever”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You’ll notice such statements are without actionable steps but that’s besides the point…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the majority of this year, the world has sat in a sort of gripped tension as the threat of “going nuclear” has escalated. Indeed the threat of nuclear weapons is synonymous with the end of the world. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Following the incident, the US Interior Department began their investigation of US schools and uncovered over nine graves of indigenous children at the Carlisle Indian Industrial school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States. What followed since has brought forth to the colonist public’s attention the systemic destruction of indigenous communities, cultures, and peoples.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Communism forbade any dreams of travelling abroad. Apart from going to some other communist countries nearby, one couldn’t imagine any trip to Europe unless they belonged to the upper echelon of the Party. My parents did not belong to the Party at all- minor intellectuals could escape such honour, since they were neither the praised workforce nor dangerous through their profession. I also managed to avoid becoming a member of the Romanian Communist Party, but only for a couple of years - and then in 1989 the Revolution came and many things changed. For me, the most important achievements were the freedom of speech and the fact that my dream of travelling across the borders could finally become true.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, forest fires are proliferating. The current temperature is around 1.1. degree centigrade above pre-industrial levels. This increase in temperature could be attributed to anthropogenic activity-induced global warming. The concentration of gases like carbon dioxide is increasing continuously in the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activities like fossil fuel-based power generation and the use of fossil fuels in internal combustion engines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, USA recorded high amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases trap infrared radiation leading to a spike in global temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Emotions change the way we see the world”. This is a quote by Paul Ekman and it has been interpreted in so many different ways in so many movies and books. Emotion is a powerful word and dictates a huge part of our lives, but it is surprising to see that a minuscule amount of people know about emotional health and even a smaller number work towards achieving it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the book “Chaos of Standing Still” by Jessica Brody, the hero, Ryn, is dealing with the insurmountable loss of her childhood best friend, but rather than facing her grief, sadness and anger, she just buries these feelings under a rock. She doesn’t cry for a year and cuts everyone out of her life, while just clinging to the last memento of her best friend (an unread message). When she finally lets go and embraces that grief and cries, she starts seeing things clearly. She finally feels happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Up to now, I have mostly shared my impressions on art intended as &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/art&#34;&gt;visual art&lt;/a&gt;, examining paintings or sculptures. I have rarely strayed into technical intricacies when writing about art because when I decide to talk about a topic, I do not follow particular selective criteria, I simply rely on my instinct, on the urgency to share emotions and these are almost always solicited by the great works of art history. This time I felt the same solicitations and emotions that I have just mentioned, and I discovered them in part thanks to a casual &amp;ldquo;encounter&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 7th July, the Human Rights Council passed a resolution on the protection against violence and discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. That’s no big deal, one would imagine, but sadly, for the United Nations, it is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is why a few months ago UN-aligned launched a campaign to bar countries that &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/letters/counties-who-criminalise-homosexuality-must-not-be-allowed-a-seat-on-the-unhrc/&#34;&gt;criminalise LGBTQ+ rights from the Human Rights Council&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the fact that our open letter to the United Nations was backed by several organisations and human rights activists, the letter was ignored.&lt;a href=&#34;https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/G22/407/77/PDF/G2240777.pdf?OpenElement&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I went to visit a friend of mine, it has been a while since I visited her and when we sat down and started chatting. She started telling me the story of a neighbour of hers in the camp who got very sick with corona and her children started running around to help her. She was then admitted to the hospital and put on an oxygen cylinder. The story filled me with sadness and thoughts filled my head. What is this epidemic that has taken over the whole world and claimed the lives of many friends and loved ones?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the law of the jungle, kleptocracies are shielded by plutocracies. The latter keeps the former in power. A reality all too familiar in a world dominated by the black and white absolutisms of realpolitik. It is for this reason that geopolitical power alliances currently assume complete precedence over the rule of international law. Dictatorial regimes almost always double up as localised kleptocracies. They serve as the ultimate fodder for competing foreign policy interests allowing world powers to act unilaterally outside the purview of international law. Such exchanges are all too typical of fledgling geopolitical arenas in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Ukraine Recovery Conference: When Guterres (almost) told Russia to piss off</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Ukraine Recovery Conference, which was held in Lugano Switzerland, on the 4th and 5th of July.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The event was attended by over 40 nations and nearly 20 international organisations who approved the Outcome Declaration, vowing support for Ukraine. It is estimated that the recovery plan is already worth $750 billion. The UN chief spoke boldly via a video link:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Russia’s war in Ukraine has taken thousands of lives and forcibly displaced millions of people. Millions of Ukrainians have lost their livelihoods and 90% risk of falling into poverty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mexico has finally lost its patience with the United Nations and on August 22, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced that he would be filing a formal complaint with the organisation regarding its failure to honour its commitment to supply the country with 10 million COVID-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The frustration only increased as the week went on, even as the World Health Organisation offered to ship over some of the owed vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Sep 2022 10:00:00 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/solitary-confinement-is-cruel-and-amounts-to-torture/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Solitary confinement often achieves fewer goals than keeping prisoners under control more quickly and satisfying a perverse need to see pain inflicted on those deemed criminally responsible, with little regard for the consequences. In doing so, the prolonged use of solitary confinement contravenes many national statutes. These include the 8th Amendment to the US Constitution, the Nelson Mandela Rules put forth by the UN, China’s Prison Law and European Prison Laws. In 2011, UN Special Rapporteur for Torture Juan E Mendez claimed that in many cases, it breaks international law, and he has called for a ban.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/its-barbaric-and-repulsive-lets-axe-the-death-penalty/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Put simply, the death penalty involves legally killing an alleged criminal. “Alleged”, not only because the person may not have committed the crime in the first place, but equally because the crime may have been labelled as such only due to the distorted perspective of the lawmakers. At times, this perspective is biassed in favour of jealousy, bigotry, the acquisition of wealth and power; or the neutralising of a rival or critic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is undeniable that football has a problem with sexism, which is why the Lioness’ (English Women’s football team) victory on Sunday 31st July 2022 at the Women’s European Championship means so much. I am a 23-year-old English woman who grew up playing football, and I had never even thought to dream that I might watch the England Women’s team win whilst 17.4 million people tuned in to watch. Very few did; it simply seemed impossible.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/the-gordian-magazine/gordian-september-issue-vol-6/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Executing a human being and punishments like solitary confinement are as coldblooded and premeditated as murder and torture can get. They are not in self-defence, because the danger has passed. It is not justice, because a person can always outweigh their deeds, and they can change, given the chance. The theme of this series is still justice and in this issue, we are looking at it from different angles, including those phoney ones imposed on the guilty with little or no respect for their welfare and human right. This issue offers the usual mix of politics, interviews and culture by UN-aligneders across the world, including Ruby Goldenberg, Carla Pietrobattista, Katharina Wüstnienhaus, Victoria Davila, Partho Chatterjee and Maya Bearyman, Cristina Mihailescu, Omar Alansari-Kreger, Atika Harba and Sonia Roopnarain.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Mridul Wadhwa, and I am originally from India, and I’ve lived in Scotland since 2004. I started working in the violence against women or gender-based violence sector in 2005. With a small break in between, I’ve worked in that sector since then.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I primarily worked with minority ethnic women, immigrant women, and women from communities of colour living in Scotland. For most of that time, my job was to work with the white majority community, primarily service providers, to help them develop an understanding of what kind of barriers minority ethnic women in Scotland face when experiencing and leaving abusive relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Pertaining to human rights and global justice, I request that the OHCHR address and take action to eliminate harmful conversion practices that promote violence and invalidate the LGBTQIA+ community worldwide. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the July 2022 issue of The Gordian. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was obvious to most that civilisation shall have had to deal with far more than a war of aggression after one of Putin’s casual malign interferences around the world morphed into an unscrupulous war in &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/ukraine/&#34;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. A social and economic crisis was, perhaps, expected. Four months on, however it is clear that we are heading towards far worse: an orgy of human rights violations spearheaded by unsavoury governments and bureaucrats who are supposed to protect the rule of law and human dignity.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Her father, Leslie Stephen, was an eminent Victorian critic and man of letters. He was the first editor of the Dictionary of National Biography. He was married twice. His first wife was William Thackeray’s daughter Minny.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After her death, he married Virginia’s mother, Julia Duckworth, who was also from an illustrious family. She was a widow and had three children from her first marriage. One of these children, George Duckworth, sexually harassed Virginia later on in life, devastating her psychological stability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Australia Needs to Legalise Drugs</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/australia-needs-to-legalise-drugs/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many drugs taken for pleasure in Australia are illegal. Examples include cannabis (cannabis can be grown and consumed legally, but not sold, in the Australian Capital Territory), heroin, ice (crystal meth) and many others. Some drugs taken for pleasure are legal, such as nicotine, with tobacco smoked by 2.5 million Australians, and alcohol, drunk at least once per week by 8 million. In addition, about 800 prescription drugs are subsidised under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Prescription drugs are reported to be misused by around &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/dec/19/prescription-drugs-misused-by-one-million-australians-in-year-report-shows&#34;&gt;1 million Australians&lt;/a&gt;. Cannabis can be taken legally for medicinal purposes in all Australian states by people with certain limited classes of health problems. The obvious question is – why are some drugs legal and others illegal?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Water is one of the stanchions of life. Around 60 % of the human body is made up of water. Drinking water from pristine sources has been linked to a higher lifespan. Water provides oxygen in the form of dissolved oxygen to marine organisms. Global warming leads to an increase in the temperature of the water. This reduces the amount of oxygen dissolved in the water proving detrimental for aquatic life.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My cultural background and my personal tastes have always made my interests oscillate (also for the purposes of research and study) between figurative and written art. There is a topic that thanks to certain dynamics of realisation and conception, allows me to combine these two main fields of interest in a single analysis: graffiti. In fact, in this &amp;ldquo;category&amp;rdquo;, the testimonies on the wall and the writing often merge into a single genre.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-the-acquis-communautaire&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. The Acquis communautaire&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Acquis Communautaire is the EU rule book that protects all member states&amp;rsquo; citizens under the rule of law. Fun fact, if you read two pages of this EU treaty an hour, without any breaks because duh, stuff your dinner plans, you’ll be through it in just 4.5 easy years!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This ginormous legal textbook, which consists of 35 chapters within &lt;a href=&#34;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=COM:2001:0645:FIN:EN:PDF&#34;&gt;80,000 pages&lt;/a&gt;, is a combination of all European legislation, including all treaties, directives and regulations established by the EU&amp;rsquo;s institutions, as well as all decisions rendered by the European Court of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Golden Curtain: Does the EU Stand on the Side of Justice?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many criticisms have been levied at the EU, a fair amount, as we shall see, may be justified, but most are part of that process that developing organisations with such a mighty mandate have to go through. All said and done, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks, as Britain’s ever-increasing list of post-Brexit crises, on the one hand, and the eagerness of neighbouring nations to join, on the other, makes evidently clear. There is, however, one flaw that unless remedied as a priority, will risk making the Union a gentlemen’s club, whose head is very much up its own backside. Rude language, but the reality is far ruder. I am referring to the EU’s callous exclusivity, which I will refer to as its Golden Curtain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United States, although a mighty country, has its flaws. One of its flaws is how some lobbying groups hold immensely more significant sway than others, thus unfairly eliciting beneficial results for a minority group. Another such flaw is the restriction of representatives to be solely those who may afford to run. These systemic flaws, among others not mentioned, when compounded together, erode democratic representation and must be viewed as an existential threat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Via a video address to the UN security Council on April 5, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky urged the Council to expel Russia “so it cannot block decisions about its own war”, which he emphasised was responsible for “the most terrible war crimes”. Some days ago, on June 28, he went further and called for a complete expulsion, adding that an international tribunal should investigate &amp;ldquo;the actions of Russian occupiers on Ukrainian soil&amp;rdquo; so that the Kremlin could be “brought to justice”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Based on a recommendation from the European Commission, the European Council can grant Candidate Status to prospective members of the European Union. The right to join the block, however, is not one that is automatically granted to countries who receive a candidacy status.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the European Council decides to begin accession negotiations with the candidate country, the Commission evaluates the application in light of the Copenhagen criteria, which we will talk more about below, and formulates an opinion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United States Supreme Court ruled on January 22, 1973, that under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, a person’s choice on whether or not to have an abortion was protected in the United States and could not be criminalized. This constitutional right would stand for nearly 50 years and result in safer abortion procedures and reproductive healthcare that saved lives across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the developing decision was leaked prior to its final release, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.loc.gov/item/usrep410113/&#34;&gt;Roe v. Wade&lt;/a&gt; was officially overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 24, 2022, marking the erasure of progress for human reproductive rights in the U.S. and leaving the decision of legalizing abortion up to the states.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the July issue of The Gordian. The European Union is a remarkable institution, but the callous exclusivity of the block has risked making the Union a gentlemen’s club, whose head is very much up its own backside. The “Golden Curtain” of Europe is turning it into a fortress, a type of Noah’s Arc that cares little or nothing for the lives of others. In this issue, we will focus on justice across the European block.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

A study published today in the journal Royal Society Open Science confirmed the discovery of a new abelisaurid dinosaur that lived more than 98 million years ago in the Bahariya Oasis depression of Egypt’s Western Desert. Studies on the fossil of the yet unnamed dinosaur took several years since its discovery in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doni Tondo, a renowned artwork by Michelangelo, has long been a source of inspiration for art enthusiasts and critics alike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for me, this masterpiece holds a deeper significance, evoking a sense of personal validation and ego boost. Join me in exploring the depths of Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s Doni Tondo as we analyse its style and history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-was-the-doni-tondo-painted&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When was the Doni Tondo painted&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Doni Tondo, a masterpiece created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/michelangelo/&#34;&gt;Michelangelo Buonarroti,&lt;/a&gt; was painted between 1505 and 1507. Despite being a young artist at the time, Michelangelo had already achieved significant success with his earlier works, earning widespread praise from patrons and the public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The political movement to unite the world is nearly one hundred years old. Most identify the Campaign for World Government founded in 1937 by Lola Maverick Lloyd and Rosika Schwimmer as the genesis of the movement. Since then the world has transformed in ways unimaginable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, humanity is grappling with a growing pile of existential global challenges. Twentieth-century holdovers like poverty, inequality, human rights abuses, corruption, and the threat of nuclear war are now being complemented with an array of new challenges like the climate crisis, misinformation, and of course — the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The biblical story of the Tower of Babel portrays God rather like the trickster Loki, more intent on mischief, than promoting harmony. Surveying the city and the tower that the descendants of Noah had started to build in order to achieve a level of security and prestige, God says: “If as one people, all sharing a common language they have begun to do this, then nothing they plan to do will be beyond them. Come, let’s go down and confuse their language so they won’t be able to understand each other.&amp;quot; (Genesis 11: 6-7) The final touch was scattering the people all over the world. (Genesis 11:8)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From February 24th until now, nearly tens of thousands of people have been either injured or killed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. This is an unfortunate number of people, especially so when considering the number of refugees fleeing Ukraine; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/conflict-ukraine&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;with more than five million leaving Ukraine in search of safety. The people of Ukraine have been pushed from their homes, forced to leave behind their lives, families, friends, and pets; but they are resilient people and have given the world personal insights to life in Ukraine post-invasion. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One day, my little sister and I were studying for the high school exams, so we were all sitting very quietly. Suddenly we heard the sound of shooting near our camp; not only close, but actually in the camp. We started hearing the voices of children screaming and crying, and they all scrambled for their tents or perhaps entered a neighbour’s tent because of the fear and panic. We subconsciously put our heads to the ground and we started wondering what was going on. What are these sounds?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/culture/doris-lessing-subjecting-a-divided-civilisation-to-scrutiny/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doris Lessing was born in Iran on the 22nd of October 1919 to Alfred Cook Taylor and Emily Maud McVeigh. Her parents were both very involved in the Second World War. Her father was an active fighter and her mother was a nurse. It was in this capacity that Emily Maud met Alfred, who had been seriously injured in battle. His leg was, in fact, eventually amputated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Doris Lessing spent the first six years of her life in Tehran, where her father worked at the Imperial Bank of Persia. After a brief return to England the family moved to Zimbabwe, which was then known as Rhodesia. There, Alfred invested all his capital on a 3000 acre farm which he hoped to develop. Life in southern Africa was to leave an indelible influence on Doris Lessing&amp;rsquo;s existence and on her written work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Noor is sharing her experience as an immigrant child who came to England in the 70s from Morocco. At the time, Noor was still grappling with the English language and finding her place in High School.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have very vivid memories of 1977 specifically because it was the Queen&amp;rsquo;s Jubilee. There were huge street parties and a pure celebratory atmosphere on that day. By this time, my mum was on a road trip to Morocco and I&amp;rsquo;d stayed behind in England with my older sister.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pollution from transportation is an inexorable contributor towards climate change. Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) powered vehicles use fossil fuels like Compressed Natural Gas, Gasoline, Diesel etc. Here, an interesting trend is observed. The higher the hydrocarbon, the greater is the extent of pollution caused because of it. This could be attributed to the presence of a larger number of impurities in the liquid stage compared to the gaseous stage. Thus, the extent of environmental pollution caused by Diesel powered vehicles is greater than Natural Gas based vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Although this may come across as helping, it is in actual fact the exact opposite of that because it perpetuates a mechanism of exploitation. The bully may tire of beating the same person for no tangible results, but they will never stop preying on them when their threats reap handsome rewards. Sometimes, therefore, peace negotiators are more of a problem than a solution. This is big-boy politics that treats smaller nations like pawns that can and often are compromised for the bigger picture, which is the status quo for the power brokers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 24, 2022, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was re-elected by the World Health Assembly to a second term as WHO Director-General. His renewed mandate officially starts on August 16. Dr Tedros’s experience includes field-level practice as a malariologist as well as political roles in Ethiopia, his country of origin, which included stints as Minister of Health and Minister of Foreign Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This affiliation with a repressive regime that has been accused of torture, repression, and electoral fraud did not prove problematic enough to jeopardise his first election, which owed much to the support of China. It has even been suggested that Dr Tedros’s appointment of Zimbabwean President Mugabe as Goodwill Ambassador may have been done at the behest of China, although the gushing words that accompanied the nomination appear to have been his own, despite the well-known human rights abuses Mugabe was notorious for. Unsurprisingly, Mugabe’s tenure as Goodwill Ambassador for the agency did not last more than a few days.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On May 28, Michelle Bachelet, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, ended a six-day official visit to China. The trip was controversial from the start as critics claimed it would gloss over Beijing’s human rights abuses. On May 29, the UN issued a press release aimed at addressing some of these concerns, particularly with regards to the crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong, the governance of Tibet and the treatment of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Apart from the article about forfeiting somebody else’s justice that tackles appeasement head on, the issue is also highlighted in our articles in the UN in Focus section and alluded to elsewhere, including the campaign we have been working on over the last few months, namely, trying to bar countries that criminalise LGBTQ+ rights from being given seats at the United Nations Human Rights Council. We can proudly announce that the letter has been sent to the UN to coincide with Pride Month and it has been supported by the many signatures of organisations and individuals alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

About 44 migrants trying to reach the Canary Islands have drowned off the coast of Moroccan-occupied Western Sahara after their boat capsized.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;10.05.22: &lt;strong&gt;DR Congo&lt;/strong&gt;. An overnight raid on a camp for displaced persons in the Ituri Province has left at least 14 people dead, including women and children. The attack follows a similar raid on a nearby mining site on Sunday that killed about 35 people. The CODECO militia is blamed for the brutal attacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The last judgement of Michelangelo Buonarroti</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how the mind and hands of artists make abstract and elusive concepts visible. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about all those stories whose origins are lost in the mists of time: mythological stories, religious testimonies, legends, which although familiar in terms of knowledge, lack a real visual concreteness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The images chosen by artists to convey their thoughts, their inspiration regarding these stories, become something possible, even real, for us observers. Perhaps it is thanks to these numerous testimonies that have always accompanied us in a more or less conscious way that concepts that are difficult to understand, as they are far from our daily life, become less cryptic and even, as already mentioned, familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This raises two immediate questions. What were the reasons that could have led to such a thought? And, were men keeping women away from the top?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Edward Morgan Forster: Life and works</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/culture/edward-morgan-forster-life-and-works/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/culture/edward-morgan-forster-life-and-works/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Edward Morgan Forster was born in London on the 1st January 1879. His family was typically upper-middle class. Edward Forster senior was a Cambridge graduate architect and Lily, his wife, was the adopted child of a rich family. However, when E.M. Forster was still a baby, Edward, his father, died of tuberculosis leaving his only son in the care of Lily. The child was brought up only by women, a fact which was to influence his formative years. After his father&amp;rsquo;s death, mother and son moved to Stevenage in Hertfordshire. There they lived in a large house in the middle of the English countryside, visited only by Lily&amp;rsquo;s female relatives and friends. Lily and her son developed a deep and loving relationship. In later years Forster wrote that his mother had given him &amp;ldquo;a sort of rich subsoil where I have been able to rest and grow&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1976 we moved to Poplar in London. One thing I remember is a Saturday market full of hustle and bustle, with working class people grabbing bargains under a wave of brightly coloured merchandise. We had moved into a four bedroomed Maisonette, not far from our new secondary school. We lived amongst a majority white community, but there was one black family who befriended my sister and I.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was February and incredibly cold. I remember walking to my new school that day with dread and fear twisting inside me. All that I could do was anticipate the worst things that could happen to me at the new school. The thought of having to face 30 children, not understanding much English, and trying to make sense of the school timetable, was nauseating.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Council of Europe is an organization that was founded in 1949 after the conclusion of the second World War. The council is composed of 47 member states with 27 of those states also being members of the European Union. The council operates on the mission of protecting and preserving human rights throughout its domain. This council was formed so that no atrocities such as those seen during World War II, would ever occur again. Since its inception, the Council of Europe has expanded to include six smaller councils and assemblies that actively work towards achieving goals such as abolitioning the death penalty, supporting children’s rights, ensuring fair and equal elections, and fighting for equal access to healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the days of the war in Syria, we lost our safety. We used to sleep to the sound of cannons and wake up to the sound of planes. One day, my mother asked me to go to the pharmacy near our house to buy a fever-reducing medicine for my little brother; while I was on the way back with my little sister, a shell fell in front of us. The people on the street started running to see what happened. We did not stop running until I got home, and we survived. This is one of the most difficult memories that stick in my memory and cannot be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Marine ecosystems can be restored by techniques like Floating Solar PhotoVoltaics, offshore wind farms, wind-Solar hybrids and powered Biorock accretion techniques followed by the insertion of a living coral in the skeleton to enhance biodiversity in these “rainforests” of the oceans. Oil spills from ships can have a pernicious effect on fragile marine ecosystems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The convention came into force in 1994 and established rules governing the uses of the oceans and their resources. Essentially encapsulating traditional rules for ocean use in a single instrument while also introducing new legal concepts, as well as addressing new concerns that arose with modern times. Some notable developments ushered by the convention include:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why Russian and Ukrainian are not the same language</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/culture/why-russian-and-ukrainian-are-not-the-same-language/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 13 May 2022 10:05:54 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/culture/why-russian-and-ukrainian-are-not-the-same-language/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Russian and Ukrainian are often mistaken as the same language, especially by people who have no prior exposure to Slavic languages. This confusion is justified considering that both Russian and Ukrainian use the Cyrillic alphabet, and they both belong to the language family of East Slavic (Slavonic languages). In fact, the only other East Slavic language is Belarusian. Many sources estimate Old East Slavic to have diverged into these three sub-languages as early as the fifth century. This left a large window of time for these languages to develop independently. Historical and geographical aspects have also influenced the development of these languages. This article compares Russian and Ukrainian from a number of linguistic aspects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rehauling Lady Justice: Is the United Nations guilty in Ukraine?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/is-the-united-nations-guilty-in-ukraine/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As long as international justice is left in the hands of nation states at the UN nothing will ever improve because self-interest will always win the day. This needs to change. Meet the new lady justice!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;lady-justice&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lady Justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered why representations of Lady Justice depict her in a blindfold? The accepted explanation is that the blindfold symbolises impartiality. Lady Justice is supposed to be oblivious to power, status, wealth or any other privilege. She also sports scales, which represent fairness through the weighing up of the facts, and a sword, which represents swift and thorough retribution. Although the scales date back to her earliest manifestations as the Egyptian goddess Maat, the blindfold probably originated with Hans Gieng’s 1543 Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (Fountain of Justice) in the Old City of Bern. Despite the accepted wisdom, however, one cannot help comparing the blindfold to that of “blind” Fortune, whose largess is purely random. How else can there be so much injustice in the world?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gutterres&#39; visit to Ukraine: Another blow to the UN</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/un-in-focus/gutterres-visit-to-ukraine/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 28 April, UN Secretary-General António Guterres visited Kiev directly after an official visit to Moscow. His tour included sites of suspected war crimes in Ukraine, namely the suburbs of Borodianka, Bucha and Irpin. Guterres did not hide his horror and indignation, nor did he mince his words:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;“When we see this horrendous site, it makes me feel how important it is [to have] a thorough investigation and accountability... I appeal to the Russian Federation to accept to cooperate with the International Criminal Court.”  &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, Guterres had been criticised for visiting Moscow before Kyiv, but in retrospect it became clear that his frank assessment would have been harder to voice if it were to be followed by a meeting with Putin. Of course, this did not stop Putin from blasting the Secretary-General anyway: not figuratively, but literally by bombing Kyiv during the high-profile visit. The message was loud and clear and President Zelensky summed it up nicely:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Water, water, every where, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, every where, Nor any drop to drink.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above quote from &lt;em&gt;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&lt;/em&gt;, by &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/samuel-coleridge-natural-supernatural/&#34;&gt;Samuel Taylor Coleridge&lt;/a&gt; describes part of the curse inflicted on the mariner and his crew for his having shot the albatross whose noble presence had been bestowing a blessing to their voyage. In many ways, most of our leaders are like that mariner, killing Mother Earth who guarantees our wellbeing: only that these leaders have been doing it more slowly. We are polluting the air, the land and the waters, and even though we can see the curse materialising before our very eyes, we carry on, regardless. Today I will focus on Water.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

This makes electricity purchase from clean energy sources more economically viable and environmentally sustainable for domestic as well as commercial applications. Therefore, increasing the share of clean energy sources in the energy generation mix is essentially advisable. Historically, developing nations have been dependent upon fossil fuel based power generation at large to meet their primary energy requirements.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a stone is thrown into the water, the greater the power of the blow, the greater the number of circles produced on the surface. The image of these circles that indicate the passage of the stone in the water, is the symbol that most represents the power of art. In fact, creating a work of art means launching a message whose strength, just like that of a stone, cannot be confined to falling silently into the consciousness of the recipients of the art itself; the impact must generate waves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In Lebanon, poverty-related changes have been driven largely by inflation and poverty has increased by about 33 percentage points among the Lebanese population; the increase among Syrian refugees here, however, has increased by 55 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Children have not been able to continue their studies because of closures, but they are also constrained by a lack of educational opportunities at home and the digital divide.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Putin,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not mean to be rude by not gracing your name with a salutation or title; quite the contrary; if I had done so, only obscenities would have been appropriate under the circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The situation I am referring to is, of course, your ever-increasing list of crimes: yours, plus the many your soldiers are sanctioned to carry out in your name, such as murdering innocent men, women and children, rape and pillaging. “Kill one man, and you are a murderer. Kill millions of men, and you are a conqueror. Kill them all, and you are a god.”  I see that a god is what you are aspiring to become; a sinister god of the underworld, no doubt, but don’t delude yourself! Jean Rostand was referring to the perception in the minds of fools. You are no god. You are just a serial killer, a rapist, a bully and a thief. You will join the ranks of other sadists, who like you, abused their power to bring death and destruction into the world. However, in some ways you are worse than they are. They operated in darker times, when Truth was still struggling to climb out of her well. You have not got the luxury of mitigating circumstances. Truth is easily accessible now. The fanaticism of the past had been shown up for what it is, but you embrace it and with cynical irony you justify your onslaught on Ukraine as a Nazi-clensing operation, when in fact, it is your evil that is the closest thing to Nazism the world has known since Hitler’s demise. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What does it mean to be a Syrian refugee?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am Syrian; I think this phrase is enough to indicate that I may be in Sweden, Germany, Egypt or one of the many countries Syrians have resorted to in order to survive the tragedy inside Syria. This tragedy has left Syrians under the rubble, submerged in the Mediterranean Sea as they try to cross into Europe, or languishing in a prison under interrogation; perhaps eviscerated or eviscerating themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I Am A Syrian Refugee Who Lives In Lebanon&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Climate refugees in the modern world</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A climate refugee is someone displaced from their home because of an extreme weather event caused by climate change. This particular category of refugees is coming from all over the world to various places that are not being affected as deeply by extreme weather. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is nothing new and neither is human migration. Migration has been a huge factor in international interactions since the dawn of written history. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Global climate change however, is a relatively recent occurrence. Climate change is defined as “the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a long period of time – including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns”. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Education’s Paradigm Shift: “Another Brick in the Wall!”</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a child, one gets fed a lot of crap from one’s elders. Fortunately, not all of it is swallowed. “You’ll see! As you grow older, you’ll look back at your school days and you’ll remember them as the best days of your life!” Whether the many grownups who preached this believed it or not (it may have been true for some of them), I wonder how they could have possibly thought that these words could have been considered reassuring in any way. It is like telling a prisoner in a torture chamber: “You think this is bad, wait until they put you on the rack!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exploring the difference between what is legal and what is ethical: The Gordian Magazine enters Vol. 6</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Having covered social topics in the last few issues of The Gordian, in May we will be moving on to a series that will focus on law and order. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Topics will range from international law and treaties to general crime and punishment. We will also be exploring the difference between what is legal and what is ethical, which are two very different animals. After all, most of the world’s problems today are caused by activities that are more or less legal everywhere, such as intensive animal farming, extraction and consumption of fossil fuels, suppression of human rights and exploitation. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Romania Always Welcomes Ukrainian Refugees: Support and Opportunities Await</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been a few days since Romanians stopped wearing masks. Literally speaking, we have finally been told that such protection is no longer necessary, even though the hospitals are still full of sick people. The pandemic is not over, but a greater evil has appeared at the borders of our country, an evil we would hopefully never meet face to face: war.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Terrible as it sounds and can be felt in the images broadcast 24 hours a day on all the TV stations, the war in the neighbouring country has produced an unprecedented, totally unexpected outcome: Romanians stopped wearing masks in their daily lives and started showing their true colours.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

True, sometimes the system is rigged against the people, either because of the iron grip of despotic regimes or through a flawed system that only provides an illusion of choice. What Julius Nyerere said about America, applies to many democracies: “The United States is also a one-party state but, with typical American extravagance, they have two of them.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;letter-from-the-editors&#34;&gt;Letter from the Editors&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to April’s issue of The Gordian! This issue offers the usual mix of politics and culture, with our main focus this time being on education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adrian Liberto’s article, &lt;em&gt;Education’s Paradigm Shift,&lt;/em&gt; sets the scene with a revolutionary critique of traditional schooling and a vision of a more dynamic system for the future. Jihan Al-Assad’s article further highlights hurdles in education with a first-hand account of the specific problems Syrian refugee students face trying to learn in ill-equipped camps, where the situation has now been further exacerbated by the coronavirus. This article is complemented by another by Jihan that covers the hardships of refugee life in general. Our interview (Ruby Goldberg/Noor) also relates to education and describes the difficulties faced by pupils at the mercy of a system that is quite foreign to them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the second half of 2021, we launched an &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/letters/counties-who-criminalise-homosexuality-must-not-be-allowed-a-seat-on-the-unhrc/&#34;&gt;Open Letter&lt;/a&gt; to the United Nations Human Rights Commission requesting that countries that criminalise LGBTQ+ rights be barred from forming part of the commission. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far, the letter has been signed by over a dozen LGBT+ organisations from around the globe, as well as individual activists. We originally planned to send the letter on 22 February 2022. However, owing to the latest developments in the United Nations and the ongoing war in Ukraine, we have decided to postpone the open letter as otherwise it would be sounded out by these tragic events. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We stood by and watched Putin help deliver both Brexit and Trump. We were quite happy letting him tear Syria apart. So what, he invaded Donbas? He is a cold-blooded murderer? “What then? poor beastie, thou maun live!”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“Putinism required diplomacy”, that’s what diplomats said anyway. It was obvious to most, at the time of each of these hammer blows, that Putin’s tentacles had penetrated through and influenced our democracy. Our response to this despot for his crimes? The occasional sanctions here are there. Don’t get me wrong; although they are increasingly becoming the bulwark of our international system, sanctions can work. But they won’t if we are too paralysed by indecision, or when we are at crossroads with ultra-complex choices: utilising green energy, on the one hand, or continuing importing Russian gas during a climate emergency, on the other.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After appealing to the Russian President, Volodymyr Zelenskyy only received silence in return. He therefore decided to deliver a speech to the people of Russia and to the people of the world; not as the President of Ukraine, but as he put it, as a citizen of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Zelenskyy spoke about the shared 2000km border with Russia that is today breached by almost 200,000 soldiers and thousands of military units. This situation could trigger a widespread war on the European continent. The area is now a smouldering keg that could potentially burst into a catastrophic conflagration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

At the beginning of the war in my country, Syria, I lost my husband and did not know anything about what could have happened to him. When the battles intensified, I took my children and went to my father, as he lived alone in Damascus because my mother was dead. We lived with him for about a year, and then the war broke out in Damascus as well. One day we woke up to the sound of guns, bullets, and planes. I took my children and we went with my father to take refuge in the shelters. We stayed like this for three days until we finally decided to get away from this area. We actually made our way on foot, until we approached a car that was in a traffic jam on the way to the border with Lebanon. We accosted them and found that they too were leaving Syria for refuge in Lebanon. With them we eventually reached the Lebanese border and once in Lebanon, a tent was secured for us to live in. So after witnessing so much death, we finally found safety.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;W&lt;/strong&gt;ould you entrust a child you love to the care of a school or nursery if you knew that not only many of its teachers, but the school board itself, consisted of child abusers, rapists and murderers?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course not! And yet that is exactly what we are doing when we entrust world peace and human rights to the United Nations. The enemy is not only within the walls of the United Nations, in most cases, the enemy constitutes an integral part of the organisation itself. By ‘integral’ I am particularly referring to the five permanent members (P5) of the UN Security Council. In fact, most of the world problems since WWII stem directly or indirectly from one or more of these five permanent members. The Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine is just one of the many instances of a crisis that has been caused or exacerbated by one of these powers. I have discussed the flaws of the UN at length in my recent book: &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/unravelling-the-united-nations-argead-style-officially-published/&#34;&gt;Unravelling the United Nations&lt;/a&gt;, so I will not dwell on its lack of structural integrity or its monumental failures here. Instead, I wish to focus on the current crisis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It listed a range of crimes committed by Putin ranging from mass murder to mass deceit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;vlad-the-terrible&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vlad the Terrible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You play with fire and you risk getting burned; play with the devil and you end up screwed. Sadly, this is exactly what is happening to Europe and beyond now that the demon is waving his devil’s fork and even threatening nuclear destruction. The good news is not only that we have learned a lesson, but even more remarkably, that we are prepared to suffer the consequences of our mistakes and send this devil to hell!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It should not be glorified with epithets like ‘just’ or ‘holy’; nor should it be legitimised with conventions aiming at damage limitation.” &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/in-english/#:~:text=and%20clearly%20stated.-,Article%206%3A%20War%20must%20be%20criminal%20offence.,-Reasoning%C2%A0&#34;&gt;Article 6&lt;/a&gt; of UN-aligned’s manifesto is unequivocal when it says that “war must be a criminal offence”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a blatant breach of international law and UN-aligned strongly condemns it. Countries can no longer be allowed to use the term ‘soldier’ or ‘patriot’ to justify the deployment of people to commit crimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The painful history of Ukraine — A photo timeline</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ukraine’s fate may be rooted in its heartbreaking past. In this photo timeline, which consists of more than 35 photos and 12 painful events, we’ll guide you through the county&amp;rsquo;s tragic history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;ukrainian-war-of-independence-1917-to-1921&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian War of Independence (1917 to 1921)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From 1917 to 1921, with the invasion of Bolsheviks, a series of conflicts and battles led to the establishment of the Ukrainian Republic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Ukrainian-War-of-Independence-1917-to-1921--1024x678.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A patriotic demonstration in Kyiv, Ukraine&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;holodomor-1932-to-1933&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holodomor (1932 to 1933)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Holodomor, meaning to kill by starvation, is another dark chapter in Ukraine’s history. It is widely believed that the famine was orchestrated by Joseph Stalin to impose collectivism and tamp down Ukrainian nationalism. Hunger was so common that the Soviet regime convicted more than 2,500 people for cannibalism.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are living in a difficult historical moment, in which each of us, myself included, in a more or less &amp;ldquo;blatant&amp;rdquo; way, has had the need to talk about covid. In this article, however, I would like to describe how covid spoke to me. Fortunately, I have not experienced the disease, but I have certainly experienced all the restrictions associated with it in a conscious way. The silence and being at home awakened in me memories: images and situations from the past that everyday life had made me put aside. With a different and certainly more mature awareness, I was able to clearly define what is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-first-shot-at-an-east-african-community&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The First Shot at an East African Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The three countries of East Africa - Kenya, Tanzania (which is a union of Tanganyika and Zanzibar), and Uganda - were administered as one unit under the East African Common Services. When granting them independence, the British expected that these countries would eventually integrate into one political union, as had happened to Tanganyika and Zanzibar.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concept of a political federation for East Africa emerged in the 1960s. The idea took shape in 1967 when the East African Community, a confederate government, was formed by the republics of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania. The heads of states of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, by signing the treaty establishing the community, became its patron and hoped to use the community as a launching pad towards deeper political, economic, and socio-cultural integration.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many may not know, but the United Nations is the creator of some of the worst “&lt;a href=&#34;https://media.un.org/en/webtv&#34;&gt;reality TV&lt;/a&gt;” of all time. Whether they are shows about a climate convention where the organisers forget to invite representatives from countries that are literally drowning, as was the case with COP26, or an ongoing show about five thugs who think they have a monopoly on truth, sit at a horseshoe-shaped table and maintain international peace by telling everyone not to go to war without their permission, even though that’s exactly what every single of them has done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The master of the Bildungsroman: Leslie Poles Hartley’s life and works</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/culture/leslie-poles-hartleys-life-and-works/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 10:45:55 +0200</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/culture/leslie-poles-hartleys-life-and-works/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Leslie Poles Hartley was born in England on the 30th of December 1895. He grew up in the relatively peaceful period of Edwardian England. He had an excellent education at Harrow and subsequently at Oxford University. After the outbreak of the First World War, the peace and tranquillity of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.trafalgar.com/real-word/definitive-downton-a-guide-to-edwardian-britain/&#34;&gt;Edwardian English society&lt;/a&gt;, which he had been accustomed to, was suddenly disrupted. Hartley joined the army as an officer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;He was never involved in fighting, but gained a certain amount of experience of the military world. After the war, he became a journalist, reviewing literature for the Spectator, the Observer and other London papers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-decriminalisation-of-drugs-mean-vs-what-does-it-mean-to-legalise-drugs&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does decriminalisation of drugs mean VS&lt;/strong&gt; what does it mean to legalise drugs&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When we talk about decriminalising all drugs, within a legal framework, we don’t necessarily refer to them being legalised. In other words, drug ownership and personal use would itself still be legally prohibited, but violations of those prohibitions are deemed to be exclusively administrative violations and are removed completely from the criminal realm. Ideally, we want the legalisation of all drugs, however, decriminalising them could also be an attractive short-term solution. Here are five arguments for legalising drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During her internship with UN-aligned, Jihan Al-Assad was asked to write about her life inside the refugee camp in Lebanon. Her experiences, along with those of other refugees are published in a new series titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/diaries-from-refugee-camps/&#34;&gt;Diaries from Refugee Camps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday-1122021&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday 1/12/2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of a new month and the end of a whole year. This does not feel like the beginning of a month or a day or anything new. I am afraid because I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what is coming to me, and this idea is a big horror for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Society is a raft made from the wreckage of our dreams and fears. Space is limited and we struggle to keep aboard, scrambling for the middle ground so we do not have to witness those sacrificed at the rim: pushed, or slipping, or just unable to grab a hold. Smug, we pretend that they are not there or that they are so out of reach that we are quite exonerated from any obligation to assist them from their demise. Some would rather swim. Others choose to drown. Reality, as we perceive it, as we live it, is a fragile thing, so we cling on to the raft despite its many flaws. We ignore them. We justify them. We acknowledge and accept them. Often, religions sanction them. And so we paddle on, tossed by abysmal waves, never quite certain where we are heading.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The crisis in Ukraine has been intensifying for weeks and yet the Security Council waited until January 31 to convene in order to have a discussion on the issue and it did so only because it was urged to by the US. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

As always, the title reflects the some of the themes we will be covering and it comes from a 1969 article in Life magazine by Edward Kern: “The counter culture” he wrote, “has its sacraments in sex, drugs and rock.” Of course, it was Ian Dury and the Blockheads who made the phrase famous with the 1977 song &lt;em&gt;Sex &amp;amp; Drugs &amp;amp; Rock &amp;amp; Roll&lt;/em&gt;. “Counter culture” sums it up really.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tensions between Russia and Ukraine have been mounting for weeks now and for some reason, everyone expected that this particular Security Council session would narrow the wide divide between Russia and the so-called West. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with being pessimistic, but it is a fool who watches the same episode and expects a different ending. Here are three of the main sides of the argument presented during the Council meeting.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

During the month of December we were constantly bombarded with images that create romantic and idealised suggestions. Despite the decidedly muffled atmosphere, I will try to talk with you about the nativity in art trying to maintain a critical, attentive and open attitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The advent of machines has heralded a new dawn for Homo Sapiens. Machines date back to antiquity. They have been ubiquitous right from the era of the first industrial revolution till the present, contemporary fourth industrial revolution. From tangible mechanical gears to the intangible virtual space, the progress mankind has made in the field of technology from the 1st Industrial Revolution to the 4th has been stupendous and awe inspiring. The effects of machines on our homes has been astounding.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Disheartening revelations about the UNHCR in Lebanon — A refugee’s perspective</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/unhcr-in-lebanon/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The primary mission of the United Nations Refugee Agency, the UNHCR in Lebanon, is to provide emergency assistance to those forced to flee their homes. This is the first step towards long-term protection and rehabilitation, as well as a means to support in various sectors for refugees and asylum seekers. But how is this achieved in the current reality, especially in a country like Lebanon? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;positive-action-of-the-unhcr-in-lebanon&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive action of the UNHCR in Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The achievements of the UNHCR include:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-migrant-problem&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The migrant problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has studied their history will know that migrations are what shaped the world as we know it today, both politically and ethnically. At times these migrations were peaceful. Often, they were predatory. At times they were gradual, spreading like an oil stain; often, they were sudden and quite alien, like a frenzied splash from a Jackson Pollock paintbrush. At times the end result was growth and a fusion of cultures; often, it was genocide. So we built walls of brick and paper to keep the undesirables out. Most of us belonged to those undesirables once, but that was a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Domenico Lucano declared as UN-aligned Person of the Year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UN-aligned has chosen Domenico Lucano as its Person of the Year 2021. The ex-mayor of the Italian town of Riace has been chosen for his vision regarding the integration of refugees into their destination of choice, while at the same time revitalising a dying town.  Riace became a showcase of prosperity and integration and was hailed in 2016 by Fortune magazine as one of the world’s 50 greatest leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the 30th September 2021, Lucano was sentenced to 13 years in prison for abetting illegal migration. His “crimes” included awarding waste collection contracts to companies that were set up to help migrants look for work and arranging a marriage of convenience to help a Nigerian woman escape prostitution and find legal work. The accusation that he enriched himself in the process, seems contrived, considering he does not even have the funds to pay for his legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following interview was conducted in November 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tell-me-about-yourself-and-your-children&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about yourself and your children?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My name is Amna; I am 33 years old. I live in Lebanon in a Syrian refugee camp. I have two children, a son and a daughter. My husband was lost in Syria, and I fled with my children from the war and came to Arsal to seek safety away from the difficult conditions of the war that destroyed our lives and the childhood of my children. I tried to work to meet the needs of my children, but I could not for fear of leaving them alone in the tent and I wanted to teach them and follow their school lessons.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Research on mRNA technology is also longstanding and has been conducted for decades. What is new, however, is the ability to harness the power of mRNA in developing state-of-the-art vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Artemisia, also known as the mugwort flower, is a symbol of gratitude, the leaves of the plant give energy and certainly have nothing to do with addiction to absinthe, a substance obtained from them, which generates addiction when associated with alcoholic substances. Gratitude is the feeling that each of us should have towards every artist. Here, we can also grasp the energy and strength in art through historical information referable to a great woman and artist: Artemisia Gentileschi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I will talk about my place of residence in one of the camps in Lebanon, Arsal, and how I was able to adapt to this difficult life, which does not resemble life at all. It is only days that pass without taste. One of the most difficult days of my life was when I was fifteen years old. My family decided that we should live In a refugee camp. At that time, misfortune and sadness overtook me, and I went into a state of depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After our overview of post-war British drama with a survey of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFPD3yGlnWubBApVyOyjFgWhXeP1qBShaTKmbLeM_8I/edit#&#34;&gt;Theatre of the Absurd&lt;/a&gt;, let us now look at another important literary movement that developed after the end of World War II. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The end of the war left a sense of discontent and disillusionment, especially with the younger generation. As society developed into a more affluent capitalistic and class-conscious structure, the younger generation became aware that the poorer classes were being exploited and this prompted them to voice their anger. A new class of writers, known as the Angry Young Men, came into being. They were expressing their anger through various literary genres, in particular through prose and drama.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cherry picking justice: 9 rings of moral tunnel vision</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/nine-rings-of-moral-tunnel-vision/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deluded people generally believe that they would have been on the right side of history, without ever really questioning whether they are on the right side of what is making history. Sure, now, most people are convinced that they would have been against slavery, child labour, the burning of heretics and cannibalism&amp;hellip; but given their same mindset, would they have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All those practices were legal or socially acceptable; and sadly, for most of us, that social acceptability is what defines our morals. Only activists, innovators, rebels and the like push those boundaries, often at a crushing personal cost, until one fine day, after they may have been dead, buried and forgotten for many years, the lazy majority mindlessly enjoys and takes for granted those hard-won rights. The problem is not only the perpetrators of injustice. As Einstein rightly pointed out:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The mere mention of the word ‘refugee’ immediately evokes scenes of pain, sadness, hardship and cold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Syrian refugees in Lebanon seem fated to suffer in all seasons. After the summer heat they face a wave of frost and snow, with cracked tents that do not protect against cold or rain. In addition, the lack of heating, coupled with malnourished bodies, means that the coronavirus is much more of an existential threat. They suffer; just as migrants and other refugees do, whether it is on the Belarusian-Polish border or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have yet reached my own style in writing and I don&amp;rsquo;t even think I want to reach it so as not to end up entangled in webs created by myself. I do not love to rely on chance, but do enjoy spontaneous and sudden thoughts. Precisely for this reason, following what came to my mind as soon as I delivered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/when-art-is-mystery-the-sculpture-of-the-veiled-christ/&#34;&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to continue talking about freedom of expression in art, just as I had already done when talking about &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/the-perfected-thought-michelangelo-buonarroti/&#34;&gt;Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s Pietà Rondanini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Croatia and Serbia, once brothers united, have experienced many conflicts since the collapse of Yugoslavia in 1991. In fact, conflicts existed even prior to the demolition of Yugoslavia and can even be traced back as a cause for its collapse. Thus, it is worth looking at the role of language in this conflict. More specifically, how the classification of two languages can be utilized as a tool, sometimes even a weapon. We do this by answering the following question: “Are Serbian and Croatian two different languages, or simply two dialects of the same language”?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last issue we saw how Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/samuel-beckett-harold-pinter-two-giants-of-the-theatre-of-the-absurd/&#34;&gt;developed a new drama&lt;/a&gt; that was characterized by features that had nothing in common with the prevailing criteria of the time: the Theatre of the Absurd. In this issue we shall take a closer look at Nobel Prize winner Harold Pinter, one of the most influential modern British dramatists with a writing career spanning over more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-federalism-is-not-enough&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When federalism is not enough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFR Yugoslavia, or simply Yugoslavia) fell apart in the early 1990s, its ruins bred unimaginable chaos and destruction. Even though the founding of the federation dated back to anti-Fascist resistance following the occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers in 1941, the Kingdom itself had been a precursor to the entity since the end of WWI. In the light of this common history and the predominantly Slavic ancestry, the bloodbath that followed, which dragged on for a decade (1991-2001), seems all the more outrageous.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;humanity-faces-immense-challenges&#34;&gt;Humanity faces immense challenges&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many young people are global. Growing up online has predisposed a generation to a cosmopolitan perspective previously only accessible by the elite. Interacting with a culture different from your own has become a commonplace occurrence online, which has led many to retreat into safe, echo chambers with people of the value system. This retreat is exemplified by private chat groups which at best, provide a welcoming space for a niche community, and at worst, provide a space for terrorists to plan attacks. Yet, if you’ve grown up online, you’ll know that an echo chamber is far less fun than a debate space. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions are three fundamental facets of any progressive civil society in the 21st century. Therefore, as the UN is in many senses the world’s guardian, one of its utmost duties is to promote, instil and maintain these components globally to ensure collective harmony.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2015 – and since the UN’s conception – promoting peace, justice and strong institutions has been at the forefront of the UN’s agenda. This is evident with UN member states dedicating an entire Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) towards this pledge, which will see these beliefs transformed into formal and legitimate processes worldwide by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EU&amp;rsquo;s ban on animal testing for cosmetics is under threath as new analysis (link) finds that cosmetics sold in the EU and UK contain chemicals tested on animals. Furthermore, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is requesting new animal tests on ingredients that have been used in cosmetics safely for years. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;More than 400 animal rights organizations and companies, including PETA, The Body Shop, Dove and it´s parent company Unilever have signed and sent an open letter to the Presidents of the European Commission, the Parliament and the Council to fully commit to the EU-regulation and continue with its course for a global ban by 2023.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;and those black fellas believed these white fellas spirits of their ancestors (pale time travellers of everywhen) and those black fellas received venereal, opium, rum and pox and they returned witchetty grubs, honey ants and fruit bats and the white fellas killed no one with their guns because the new land was called &lt;em&gt;terra nullius&lt;/em&gt; (land belonging to no one) and it was fair to say that these white fellas did not include themselves nor irony in their census taking and the captain struck the collarbone of the elder (he that had helped himself to the white fellas shovel) and the aborigine elder embraced the captain and spread his arm to indicate everything he could see and the captain surrendered his shovel of wrought iron just as black fellas shared their axes of polished greenstone and so it was with ropes and stakes and sacred land; these white fellas pushed the black fellas further from the sea, scattered burial totems of coral, red basket and seagull feather and there was bile and spleen between the groups and dead black fellas (females and young, too) and the aborigine elder pushed the collarbone of the captain and the captain knew it was wrong to survey and deed what wasn’t theirs and he was ashamed and he agreed that his voice was no greater than the magpie or the blue winged kookaburra and he negotiated to settle the interior space of &lt;em&gt;terra nullius&lt;/em&gt; (that ground that was less hospitable like them) and handcuffs and leg irons fell from the poors and politicals and these made a mountain of metal where everyone was free to piss and the captain cast off his blue jacket and white waistcoat and humbled himself to learn yellomundi (or storyteller) and butbut (or heart) and he was granted initiation by they that met and decided he was ten years old and he was painted with red clay and fat of the wallroo and wombat and he received cuts to his chest arms shoulders and buttocks and sand in each produced voluminous scars and the penis of this white fella was split with a stone knife and a front tooth was knocked out to mark him as community and he danced the tree lion climbing ripping and pulling but laying in peace with brother and sister alike and he sang the songlines that trek creation and he blew didjerry didjerry through termite eucalyptus, pressed his lips to beeswax and shook out grins and guffaws and the black fellas did not call him apostle but he returned his blind eye seeing to the white sails of sirius of the orion and he stayed the cannons and six-pounder guns and his voice was dreamtime and ancestral beings and why it is that men and women walk upright and those that saw and heard were ashamed and they pushed the collarbone one of the other and they agreed against greed to call this place “must be there somewhere land” and it remains so to this day&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kamchatka sits in the far east of Russia with one arm brushing past Alaska and another reaching down to Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A region famous for active volcanoes and a huge population of Brown bears.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although Kamchatka has stunning nature, the territory can be hostile and dangerous for unprepared tourists, and those who are not local should travel with a guide for their own safety.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/1.-Tolbachik-volcano-768x1024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Arriving to the vicinity of the Tolbachik volcano, a black desert with volcanic sand.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;“Disaster… it could happen to anyone.” Think about it too much and you will go mad: that endless list of slings and arrows. Yes, it could happen to anyone, but it is best to plod along as though it could never happen to us. Perhaps they deserved it. Karma. Their suffering is like a parallel universe: it need never touch us…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this issue of &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/the-gordian/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gordian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we cover various social issues ranging from rough sleeping to poverty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>UN-aligned calls on UNHRC to ban members that criminalise homosexuality</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of the United Nations’ Declaration of Human Rights, we, the undersigned firmly believe in “the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family”. This is “the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world”, whereas “disregard” and “contempt” for these rights “have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whilst many member states flout human rights on a regular basis, certain states actually enshrine these abuses in law. This is very much the case with LGBT+ rights in as much as almost a third of United Nations’ member States criminalise homosexuality with penalties ranging from death and lengthy prison sentences to beatings and fines. This proportion does not include States that oppress the LGBT+ rights in other ways, such as Hungary and Poland. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Poverty, to put it simply, is one of humankind’s greatest ills and despite various ways to quantify, analyse or measure it, the problem remains unsolved. With the world finding itself in unprecedented straits owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has not only claimed the lives of 4,000,000, but has revealed ominous and record-breaking poverty worldwide, humanity more than ever needs its leaders to come together and work towards effective solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sixth Assessment Report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was published on August 9, 2021. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/&#34;&gt;The Report&lt;/a&gt; paints a grim picture of the planet’s health owing to human induced climate change and rising temperatures. These seem set to rise above the 1.5° threshold, which will signal a critical point of no return for those most exposed to the catastrophe.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the report, UN Secretary-General António Guterres did not mince his words:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/literature/&#34;&gt;the last issue&lt;/a&gt; we saw how some 20th century writers envisioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-dystopian-novel-beyond-utopia/&#34;&gt;a dystopian future&lt;/a&gt; in reaction to the two world wars and to the dwindling human values. Protesting against society and the situation of man, but in a different way, were the giants of the Theatre of the Absurd Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. Both playwrights developed a new drama which was characterised by features that had nothing in common with the prevailing criteria of the time. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If talking about what you don&amp;rsquo;t know well is frightening, trying to convey to others what you have studied for a long time with enthusiasm and passion is disorienting, because you proceed with the constant feeling of not saying everything or at least not saying enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I was still a university student, I was deeply impressed by Christian archeology not only as a matter of faith, but because when art is placed at the service of any kind of religion or religious thought, it generates artistic phenomena that involve social edification. Among the various topics covered during the lessons, one in particular remained with me: the tituli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/culture/the-dystopian-novel-beyond-utopia/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dystopian novel developed during the 20th century when the reality of humanity’s volatile condition became evident after both the first and second world wars. The word, dystopia, refers to Utopia, the fictitious name of an ideal country, coined by Thomas More in his famous book Libellus &amp;hellip; de optimo reipublicae statu deque nova Insula &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2130&#34;&gt;Utopia (1516)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was designed as a political, social and religious system which was not supposed to be reflected in reality, but proposed as an ideal model.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On July 29, the UN had a Security Council Arria-Formula meeting on the deteriorating situation in Myanmar. US ambassador and senior advisor for political affairs, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, summarised the dire situation, stating:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;“Humanitarian aid workers inside Burma are sounding the alarm. As a direct result of the military’s brutality and administrative failures since its coup six months ago, Burma is reeling from a surge in COVID-19 cases. This burgeoning health catastrophe comes at a time when hundreds of thousands of people remain internally displaced by the recent violence, with the World Food Program projecting between 1.5 and 2.8 million additional people in the country could now be at risk of food insecurity.”&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, there are reports of scores of doctors being rounded up and imprisoned because of the medical profession’s reaction to the coup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Climate change is the world’s biggest collective enemy, which threatens to destroy the very planet that we all live on. Whether it be rising sea levels, global warming, record-breaking temperatures, melting ice caps or an overall shift in severity of natural disasters, we as humankind need to strategise together for immediate solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the UN’s response, it can be commended for shining light upon the escalating emergency; with, for example, setting up the annual COP meetings since 1995 to assess progress in dealing with climate change. Also, at COP 21, the UN established the landmark 2016 Paris Agreement, which was signed by 196 parties worldwide and is based upon limiting a global temperature increase to below 2 degrees. Other exposure includes promoting sustainable lifestyle changes, working with climate activists, and dedicating an entire Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) to combating climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I commiserated until I found out that there actually was an alternative party that, given the chance, would put things right, yet nobody seemed to care about it. “Hey! What’s wrong with you people?” I asked my new acquaintance, pointing this out. “Many do not know; many do not care&amp;hellip;” “And what about you?”  I petitioned. “Ah, better the devil you know!” They replied smugly, as a demon dragged them to hell&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Shortly after the government announced a unilateral ceasefire, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs announced that more than 400,000 have “crossed the threshold into famine in the Tigray region.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The search for perfection, albeit in different ways and forms, has always accompanied man throughout his growth and impacted his socio-historical imprint . Starting from ideas for the improvement and evolution of the most basic aspects of life, such as the perfecting of agricultural or construction techniques, his ambition  stretched to the creation of increasingly perfect buildings and works of art. Although there is no universal concept of absolute perfection, because every judgment or perception of beauty is inevitably conditioned by its own yardstick, I find that everyone in art, in any form of art, can find or express their own idea of ​​perfection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever found yourself agreeing with a politician for no apparent reason? Have you ever thought why many people support a certain politician even though they hold a ‘foolish’ standpoint? Have you ever thought of how language influences people’s decisions in a political environment? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While it is true that humans are complex creatures and clear linear relationships rarely apply in the real world, language usage and perception undoubtedly plays a significant role in the world of politics, especially today where social factors such as gender and ethnicity are gaining more attention. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The new UN-peacekeeping budget: pun intended!</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/un-in-focus/un-peacekeeping-budget/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of June, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://undocs.org/en/A/C.5/75/25&#34;&gt;budget for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022&lt;/a&gt; was approved by the United Nations. Eye-watering sums have been allocated in order to maintain buffers between hostilities that have been stewing for decades. This is not what peacekeeping should be about. Peacekeeping ought to be a temporary measure while every effort is put into resolving a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, what is happening is that resources are being pumped into keeping the symptoms under control rather than removing the cause of the problem. As long as the wound is festering and the patient is alive, the doctor’s job is secured.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the 29 years in a row, the UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly in favour of a resolution demanding the end of the 60-year embargo on Cuba imposed by the US. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The US and Israel were the only countries opposed to the June 30 resolution: 184 voted in support of it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla did not mince his words lambasting the US for human rights violations:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The feeling I experience when plunging into the ocean of communiques from the United Nations is always the same: drowning in an alphabet soup. Often, the words are noble, the causes honourable. Occasionally they even make a difference. Report after report; document after document; resolution after resolution&amp;hellip; and yet the members of this mighty club behave like undisciplined children who delight in doing just as they please. The world of politics rolls on like a combined harvester devoid of breaks, macerating anyone unfortunate enough to get in its way. They only serve to create one grim statistic after another.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-slow-pace-of-justice&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The slow pace of justice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UN judges have still not quite finished with the aftermath of the atrocities relating to the breakup of the former Yugoslavia almost 30 years ago. On June 30, they convicted former head of Serbia’s State Security Service, Jovica Stanisic, and his subordinate Franko “Frenki” Simatovic to 12 years in prison. The two men, now in their seventies, were initially acquitted in 2013, after having entered into court custody ten years earlier, but a retrial was ordered in 2015. If UN justice were any slower, it would probably have to be a post mortem affair involving psychopomps and psychostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week Edward Mortimer, the chief speechwriter for Kofi Annan, passed away at the age of 77. He was described as “one of the lively minds surrounding the Secretary-General, given license to think and experiment at a time when the future of the United Nations was being written anew”. We wish his friends and family our deepest condolences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, however, we would like to point your attention towards a peculiar speech he made to the Oxford Union in 2017 defending why &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZm5iBZkiT8&#34;&gt;the United Nations is not a failing institution.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

The African Union has suspended Mali from the African Union over its second coup in nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;05.06.21: &lt;strong&gt;Burkina Faso&lt;/strong&gt;. At least 160 villagers were slaughtered in a brutal onslaught that ended with the village being set on fire. Islamic militants are the likely perpetrators of the attack, though no group has as yet claimed responsibility for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;12.06.21: &lt;strong&gt;Nigeria&lt;/strong&gt;. Another senseless killing spree has left 53 people dead in the north of the country.  The assailants hunted people down as they fled for their lives in a number of villages in northwest Nigeria’s Zamfara state.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

One of the more popular versions of the story relates how Marsyas had challenged the god to a musical contest that was to be judged by the Muses. The winner would have had the right to do as he pleased with the loser and when Apollo won (in some versions via a ruse) he chose to flay Marsyas for having dared challenge a god. The statue from the Giustiniani collection may have been very different in its original form and was restored extensively and with much imagination. (1st century CE)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The globally displaced rose from 79.5 million in 2019 to 82.4 million by the end of 2020, a near 3 million increase. This is as the G7 decides to take no action whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The UNHCR says that the number of refugees around the world has hit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/&#34;&gt;a new high&lt;/a&gt;, this is in spite of the pandemic, a time in which over 160 countries closed their borders. More than a third of those who fled abroad came from just five countries: Syria (6.7 million); Venezuela (4 million); Afghanistan (2.6 million); South Sudan (2.2 million); Myanmar (1.1 million). Many more are expected to have been displaced within Africa due to conflicts in Mozambique, Ethiopia and the Central Sahel region. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the 21st of June the United Nations General Assembly started publishing a number of draft resolutions calling on the colonial powers to relinquish their control on the few remaining colonies. The UN states that its target is to eradicate colonialism by 2030. To date, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.un.org/dppa/decolonization/en/nsgt&#34;&gt;17 non-self-governing territories&lt;/a&gt; remain. Of these, fifteen are governed by permanent members of the Security Council:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;10 by the UK,&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;3 by the US and;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;2 by France.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this list does not include occupied territories, such as Palestine, the Chagos Archipelago and Crimea.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Secretary General António Guterres appointed the Frenchman Jean Arnault as his envoy covering Afghanistan and regional issues. Mr Arnault is expected to support the negotiations and implementation of any agreements between the Taliban and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jean Arnault is a former philosophy student with an extensive working background in United Nations missions in Asia, including Afghanistan, Europe, Latin America, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No doubt his outstanding &lt;a href=&#34;https://cic.nyu.edu/content/jean-arnault&#34;&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; in international diplomacy will bring a massive force behind the Afghan peace talks, and although we wish him all the best, it must be said that the UN&amp;rsquo;s political response to this conflict has been largely uninspiring. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;unlike-france-the-un-must-not-suspend-its-peacekeeping-operations-in-mali&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike France, the UN must not suspend its peacekeeping operations&lt;/strong&gt; in Mali&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following Mali’s latest coup on May 24, France decided to stop joint military operations with Malian forces until it is convinced that a civilian government will be returning to power. Some may argue that the UN should also take a step back and suspend its peacekeeping operations rather than indirectly aid a regime that usurped power. This would be a mistake and fortunately one the UN is not prepared to make. After Colonel Assimi Goïta’s first coup of 18 August 2020, the UN spokesperson, Stéphane Dujarric stressed that the mission “must and will continue” and the situation is just as dire now as it was then.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Final tallies earlier this month showed that Albania, Brazil, Gabon, Ghana and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were elected as the five new non-permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The new members elected this year will be taking up their seats on 01.01.2022 and will serve for 1 year, until 31.12.2023. Four out of the Five new members have served on the council before: Brazil 10 times; Gabon and Ghana 2 times, while Albania has never served as a member. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mladic revisited: An unremarkable news item, were it not for the absurdity of the process</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb commander largely responsible for the Srebrenica Massacre in 1995 lost his appeal with the special UN tribunal set up to judge the case. He had been convicted on ten counts including genocide and crimes against humanity. This is an unremarkable news item really, were it not for the absurdity of the process.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_trials&#34;&gt;Nuremberg Trial&lt;/a&gt; (20 November 1945 - 1 October 1946) took less than a year to try 24 of the most prominent Nazis after World War II. Imagine if that trial had dragged on for as long: it would have been lingering on until the 1970’s. True, despite having been charged in July 1996, Mladic was not apprehended and extradited to the Hague for trial by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) until May 2011. Still, most of the ICTY’s cases had been dealt with by then. Nevertheless, the trial formally began a whole year later and he was not convicted until 22 November 2017, after which, the appeals process, that has only now been completed, was referred to the successor body, International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Fitzgerald&#39;s Great Gatsby VS T. S. Eliot&#39;s Waste Land: Portraying a dusty vastness where nothing thrives</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The situation that plagued the world after World War One was one of callous apathy and emotional aridity. My last article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/your-guide-to-t-s-eliot-poems/&#34;&gt;T. S. Eliot’s poetic portrayal of the early 20th century&lt;/a&gt; ended with the line, “The dehumanisation of the modern world is complete.” This ‘dehumanisation’, which Eliot portrayed as a waste land in his poetry, was also described very clearly in prose by F. S. Fitzgerald in his novel &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;According to the Palestinian health authorities, during the recent clashes between Israel and Gaza, at least 254 Palestinians including 66 children were killed. This is while more than 1,900 are reported to be wounded. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For 30 years, the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF), a nonpolitical humanitarian relief organisation, has provided the children of Gaza with free medical care. However, on the 17th of May, their main Gaza office was arbitrarily targeted by the Israeli military. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine visiting your mother or father in their home. When you arrive, you discover that they are in distress in front of the television. They look at you with fear in their eyes; you look at them and then to the ordinary television screen, not understanding the problem. Your mother or father imagines that the people on the television are home intruders, and they ask you how those people got into the house. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Your past is in front of your eyes, it’s 2014, 2012 and 2008 all over again. You cannot escape it, visual reminders are scattered all over the city. Being bombed back to the middle ages seems to be a recurring theme in Gaza. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The history concerning the Israel and Palestine conflict is complicated. What is not at all complicated, however, is whether or not it is admissible to airstrike civilian areas, news buildings, health facilities or Covid labs. Whether or not it is acceptable to take away life should not be a controversial issue, one would hope. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to achieve a robust legal system? Solutions towards comprehensive global justice</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/towards-comprehensive-global-justice/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/towards-comprehensive-global-justice/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-icj-the-icc-whose-justice/&#34;&gt;an article&lt;/a&gt; in last month’s issue of The Gordian, I highlighted some of the weaknesses of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Whilst these bodies are merely a part of a wider international legal system that is also governed by various treaties, conventions and accords, they are pivotal in as much as their focus is on safeguarding human life and world peace. My conclusion was that these two institutions were flawed, compromised and generally ineffective. In this issue, therefore, I intend to offer some concrete ideas for a robust legal system. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

In 1946, after the League of Nations ceased its operations, the Security Council was invested with most of the power of the brand new organisation, the United Nations. The five winners, let’s face it bullies, of the war, none of whom possessed any moral authority, were tasked with one noble purpose: to advocate peace. What could possibly go wrong with tasking a group of warlords with the maintenance of international peace and security? &lt;/p&gt;</description>

The five-page document covered all the main issues comprehensively and with refreshing lucidity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Statement starts by highlighting the fact that everyone has the right “to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and its applications” and proceeded to lament “the current unhealthy race among States for COVID-19 vaccines, which has created a sort of temporary monopoly by some developed States of the first vaccines to be produced.” This is underscored by the fact that current production capacity is at its limit in as much as stocks are already sold out through public procurement by such States. This has created an unacceptable situation of “health isolationism”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Justice is not a relative term, but for much of our history we have manipulated it to such an extent that we have created a parallel sort of justice. More often than not, human justice is just a sinister doppelgänger of justice in its purest form. This is because human justice depends on laws, and as we all know, laws are biased.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The justice of the Inquisition, a sharia court or the sham courts of dictatorial regimes are based on very different laws and therefore profess their own unique brands of justice. The one main thing that they do have in common, though, is that they are self-serving.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The event was presided by the Mayor of Magliano dei Marsi, Pasqualino di Cristofano. Ms. Pietrobattista will also be collaborating on the new Art Section of &lt;em&gt;The Gordian&lt;/em&gt;, which will start next month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Their success with respect to other forms of life led them to reproduce until they saturated their environment and became extinct. The reason is the uncontainable growth of the species.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Being tried by a self-serving court is not justice, but rather, quite the opposite, namely, injustice or anti-justice. However, laws are not the only factor influencing justice, as the mechanisms that are in place to apply these laws also play a crucial part in the administration of justice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations is not just any organisation. It is meant to be the organisation par excellence, it is meant to represent humankind. However, the UN spreads itself so thinly it is no wonder that it struggles to meet many of its commitments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We would like to introduce you to a new feature in The Gordian Magazine. Every month an exclusive piece will highlight the good, bad and the ugly of the events in the UN.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

You can review all the edits here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We believe the flexible roadmap of UN-aligned’s manifesto presents a safe trajectory for a united world, so as UN-aligned grows we are always seeking to refine, clarify and improve our goals and missions. The following changes have been made to the UN-aligned manifesto as of May 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>May Day protests: A celebration of spring or a day for activism? - in pictures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;May Day, Labour Day or International Workers´ Day has been celebrated in various ways throughout history. The Modern May Day is not only celebrated around the world by parades and parties, but also demonstrations and rallies in support of workers and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On May 1st, 1890, demonstrators called by the Second International gathered together to honour the martyrs of the Haymarket Affair in 1886. Since then, it has been more associated with the labour movement of the 20th century than with its roots as an ancient spring festival. This gallery guides you through some of the various different events that take place on May Day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>On the road: The story behind Santa Maria church in Valle Porclaneta</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/culture/the-story-behind-santa-maria-church-in-valle-porclaneta/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The perfect balance and harmony that govern the elements present in the church of Santa Maria in the Porclaneta in Rosciolo, Abruzzo, Italy, tends to arouse one’s curiosity with regards to its origins and history. Although much has already been said by historians and art experts, I firmly believe there are still many secrets hidden in the iconography the church is steeped in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;unexplored-secrets&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexplored secrets&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until now the elements that have found greater exposure in the historical and stylistic examination are the sculptural ones. However, I believe that the paintings in the church of Santa Maria, despite the simplicity of execution of some of them, still have much to reveal. This is particularly true of the triptych placed at the end of the right nave of the church. Here, the Virgin and Child is flanked by St. Michael holding scales in his hands and a saint with a long liturgical robe grasping a chain: St. Leonard of Noblat (also known as San Leonardo de Noblac, from the Latin &amp;rsquo;nobiliacum&amp;rsquo;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Your guide to T.S Eliot poems - April is the cruellest month</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;T.S Eliot is perhaps the best example of the modern metaphysical poet. Like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/john-donne-life-career-and-poems/&#34;&gt;17th century poet, John Donne&lt;/a&gt;, Eliot veered from the ethereal world of romance and idealisation, to head directly towards a concrete reality through conceits and extended metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;His work reflected the upheaval of the social order in the aftermath of World War I, and the failure of all of man’s social, political and philosophical aspirations. On the wake of death and destruction, all seemed to flounder on the crags of a festering humanity that had turned to superficial desires and material gain. Ethical and moral values were reduced to a vast expanse of ash and aridity; a waste land void of any humanity. Humankind had lost its soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To reject growth is to risk economic and social collapse. To pursue it relentlessly is to endanger the ecosystems on which we depend for long term survival. This delusional strategy has reached its limits. Simplistic assumptions that capitalism’s propensity for efficiency will stabilise the climate and solve the problems of resource scarcity are almost literally bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Seven Ways to Create a Healthy Economy with Kate Raworth - Podcast</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/economy/seven-ways-to-create-a-healthy-economy-podcast/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Kate Raworth first introduced her visual representation of what a healthy economy could look like in a 2012 OXFAM discussion paper titled: &amp;ldquo;A safe and just space for humanity: can we live within the doughnut?&amp;rdquo; The doughnut represented the safe space where humanity could thrive sandwiched between its inner and outer limits, namely our social and planetary boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Raworth’s 2017 book develops the idea further. The seven “ways” she explores are simple, well researched, grounded and achievable.

You may be surprised at the murky facts that this book will bring to your attention.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A thorough critique of the UN finances would therefore involve a massive amount of time and investigation, which exceeds the remit of this work. Nevertheless, even without specific details regarding UN spending, some of its weaknesses in this regard have been manifestly exposed from within the organisation. The two main criticisms concern the manifold overlaps in UN operations and the inflated salaries of UN personnel. These issues go hand in hand and can be summed up in one word: bureaucracy. They give rise to an unnecessary multiplying of well-paid personnel and a replication of resources, which means that while employees and their administrative needs receive the lion’s share of the allocated funds, identified problems are left with the crumbs. Of course, decision-making is also impaired, which in turn affects efficiency in general. Speaking at a UN Reform Event in September 2017, Secretary General António Guterres summed up the situation without mincing his words:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>GDP is an impostor, so why are we still using it to measure happiness?</title>

It sucks. Assessing the economy using GDP is destroying our planet. The global community and the United Nation’s sustainable development solutions network (SDSN) need to find other suitable alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since 2011, the SDSN, an initiative operating under the auspices of the United Nations, has been &lt;a href=&#34;https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2021/happiness-trust-and-deaths-under-covid-19/&#34;&gt;publishing a yearly report&lt;/a&gt; on how happy the world is. Embarking upon this fundamentally subjective and unquantifiable quest is no easy task and although the SDSN has significantly improved its methods to measure happiness throughout the years, it still has a long way to go before becoming perfect. This year the report used a host of different criteria to grade the happiness of a nation, these included: gross domestic product per capita (GDP), social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make your own life choices, generosity of the general population and perceptions of internal and external corruption levels. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few centuries, economics has been dominated by a doctrine of perpetual growth. The prevailing idea was that there were no limits to how much we could exploit the earth and its resources. Today we know better, but sadly, we still behave as though we did not. As Kate Raworth states in her book &lt;em&gt;Doughnut Economics: Seven Ways to Think Like a 21st-Century Economist&lt;/em&gt; (2017), the citizens of the next few decades are being cultivated in a mindset that is obsolete for the 21st century as it is “rooted in the textbooks of 1950, which in turn are rooted in the theories of 1850.” This, she points out, is proving to be a veritable disaster.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In today’s world besieged by isolationism, America First, Britain First, white supremacy, cyber bullying, homophobia, racism, vaccine tug-of-war, colonialist withdrawal symptoms (… shall I go on?) and the like, never before have the words of John Donne been more relevant; “No man is an island…”. In the age of Brexit, the very notion that every man is part of a greater humanity is a powerful assertion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the profound conviction that ‘every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main’ has a far more universal metaphorical significance; a spiritual and existential significance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

They are full of sound and fury, and yet, they signify nothing concrete, but rather an absence of something. Of course, sometimes, a lack of something can have devastating effects: if you stop my air supply, for instance, I am dead. Sanctions, however, are very limited in what they can stop, because what comes from outside one’s borders was not there in the first place, like the man upon the stair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is the duty of the Secretary General, “with the consent of the Security Council”, to keep the Assembly informed of matters that are being tackled by the Council, so that the latter’s deliberations are not infringed upon.

It is held on the 40th day of winter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pir (also translated as saint), Shaliyar is believed to have cured the daughter of the king of Bukhara; the ceremony intends to mark their marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/uraman-takht-a-journey-to-the-forgotten-lands-of-kurdistan/&#34;&gt;Uraman Takht&lt;/a&gt;, the city hosting the festival, is located in the eastern part of Marivan, Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/IMG_6422-1024x768.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Kulla Ball is a vest that is made of fleece and does not require sewing. This vest dates back several thousand years in the history of Horaman. In Horaman, if a ruler was powerful yet just, the men wore kulla balls without ears (shoulder pads), but if the ruler deviated and did not serve the land and its people, the men wore kulla balls with earmuffs and demanded to overthrow the throne.

Here are some inspirational quotes from a range of religious thinkers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;sanskrit-hymn&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanskrit Hymn&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“As different streams having their sources in different places all mingle their waters in the sea, so, Oh Lord, the different paths which men take through different tendencies, various though they appear, crooked or straight, all lead to Thee.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Chinese, foreigners are often referred to as &amp;rsquo;laowai&amp;rsquo;, a term that carries different meanings depending on context and perception. In this article, we shed light on the social and cultural aspects of language use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A single person may often be categorized and called in many different ways. I, for instance, may be categorized as ‘Iranian’, ‘Middle Eastern’, ‘brown’, etc. These separations and categorisations typically occur due to cultural differences between two or more groups. A common separation in China is that of a Chinese person and a foreigner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;family-background&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family background&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;John Donne was born in London in 1572 to a relatively wealthy family.  His father, who died when Donne was only four, was a successful tradesman and his mother, Elizabeth, was the daughter of the writer John Heywood.  Both parents were Roman Catholics and were in obvious difficulty to come to terms with the newly established Church of England.  Donne’s family, especially on his mother’s side, were persecuted for being Roman Catholics and for refusing to swear the Oath of Supremacy which acknowledged the English monarch as the Head of the Church of England.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#34;No, it&#39;s not just a snip&#34;: Why Circumcision is Legalised Child Abuse</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Mutilating the sexual organs of a child (circumcision) in the name of culture, religion or dubious preventative medical claims is outrageous and a blatant breach of the child’s human rights. Female genital mutilation is thankfully on the decline and relatively rare in developed countries. The cutting of little boys, however, is not. Approximately one third of males are circumcised worldwide. In this article I intend to highlight the futility and barbarity of the practice. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Guarded by some 25 000 troops, Joe Biden successfully took the oath of office. Earlier Mr Ex-President had taken off for Mar-a-Lago. Hopes and dreams were shattered. I felt a rush of compassion for the QAnon believers who felt betrayed realising that nothing happened; no arrests, no intervention. It is bitter to realise that the firm ground below one’s feet has collapsed. The liberating, newly revealed truth turned out to be yet another lie. Yet, the question remains: What were they thinking?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 Times the Russian Orthodox Church Flouted Norms of Decency</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under the former communist regime, the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) was suppressed, its properties confiscated and its followers harassed and imprisoned. This was until a Messiah came along. He promised the church fortune, a return to traditional values, a trip to simpler times when the state and church washed filth off each others’ backs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church walk hand-in-hand in so many ways. From the eyes of the church he is seen as a “miracle of God”, a humble Russian worshiper who wants to put the Church at the heart of Russia’s national identity. However, the Church is not the only one who has wet dreams; what the ROC knows too well is that they must return the favour. And we all know what the price of &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/vlad-the-terrible/&#34;&gt;a deal with the devil&lt;/a&gt; is: selling your soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;written-in-stone&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Written in stone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are thousands of religions in the world today and many thousands more have come and gone. Many of these claim or have claimed a monopoly on truth relating to the divine and the moral, as well as to the rituals necessary to accompany a devout life. No doubt, much good has come from these religions in as much as they have contributed to unifying people around a set of values that have generally been beneficial to society and wellbeing. Often, they coalesce around scriptures that are professed to have been inspired or dictated by heaven itself. The Abrahamic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam are very much of this mould. There is only one problem: societies change, but books do not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;How exactly has the United Nations failed in its primary mission of securing world peace? What went wrong? Who or what is to blame? Can reform absolve the organisation of its monumental shortcomings and put it back on course with regards to meeting its obligations? These are just some questions this book aims to answer. And here is the spoiler: no, the United Nations cannot be salvaged. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, the book presents an alternative vision: an organisation that can achieve the sacred mission without the shackles of obsolete structures and bullying superpowers. The organisation, UN-aligned, has already been founded and it is introduced in this groundbreaking work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Animal agriculture is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions; it is driving up climate change, antibiotic resistance, deforestation and the resulting biodiversity loss. It is also an incredibly inefficient, as well as immoral, way to feed the planet. For example, in the United States alone, 56 million acres of land are used to grow feed for animals, while only 4 million acres are cultivated to produce plants for humans to eat.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Her clients included opposition politicians, journalists, abused women and children, women who were arrested for not wearing the hijab and prisoners on death row for crimes they allegedly committed when they were minors. On several occasions she went on extended hunger strikes to protest against the severity of the prison regime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

To support your efforts The Gordian Magazine has decided to regularly include new recipes in our monthly publication. Whether you are turning vegan to reduce carbon emissions, protect animals from slaughter or to save a few quid, we got you covered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have any favourite vegan/vegetarian recipes, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/about/contact/register/&#34;&gt;send them to us&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year has been difficult for everyone. We have all had to adapt to new changes and the impact COVID-19 has had worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am a classroom teacher based in a primary school in London. Since April, we have had to face many challenges due to the pandemic. Children have done an amazing job at adapting to necessary changes and staff have been very supportive of each other. We worked flexibly and creatively to help the school run as efficiently and effectively as possible. This last term, however, has been particularly draining for all of us!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Accidentally Vegan Feature?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’ve pondered veganism but haven’t yet followed through, it may be that you are put off by the myth of the diet being restricted. As with any lifestyle change, slow and steady tends to lead to longevity. It is much better to gradually cut animal products from your diet permanently than trying to be a strict vegan for a month, falling off the wagon, and being put off enough to never try it again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Animal Equality is an international organisation that was founded in Spain in 2006 by Sharon Nuñez, Jose Valle and Javier Moreno; their one objective: to protect animals. From that moment on, a growing enthusiasm and commitment ensured the organisation’s global reach. It has expanded to such an extent, that it is now one of the most successful forces for the defence of farmed animals.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Animal Equality’s vision is that of a world where all animals are respected and protected. Our core values are compassion, determination, and effectiveness; these guide us in our daily operations, which are designed to end cruelty to farmed animals. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

The top court rejected former President François Bozizé’s bid to run for president in the December 27 election against incumbent President Faustin-Archange Touadéra. The former president failed to meet the ethical standards required.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;09.12.20: &lt;strong&gt;Ghana&lt;/strong&gt;. Results of the presidential election held on Monday have confirmed a narrow victory for incumbent President Nana Akufo-Addo. His main rival was ex-President John Mahama. Supporters of both candidates took to the streets following delays in the announcement of the results and at least five people were killed in the unrest.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

He said that he was not too unhappy with the pandemic, explaining how he and his friends took advantage of the lack of tourists on the island. They bought a boat together and spent days fishing. He says, the joy of childhood days had returned to him.

Andrea Piccinelli lives in Magliano de Marsi, a small town in the Abruzzi, Italy, at the foot of the Monte Velino. His passion is looking after his chickens. His love for the animals and his determination are so strong that you would think that these traits must be in his genes. Maybe they are, a distant relative was a Franciscan Friar Pamfilo of Magliano, famous for compassion and for his part in founding &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sbu.edu/&#34;&gt;St. Bonaventure University&lt;/a&gt; in New York. What is certain, is that this young lad has come up with his own exit strategy for intensive chicken farming. His enterprise is also a wakeup call. What will the future be for all these farm animals we have enthralled for millennia? This is something that without doubt requires considerably more thought, especially now that intensive farming may be meeting its nemesis thanks to growing public awareness into the unethical practices of the industry.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Samuel Pepys: A peep into the life of a gentleman in the Restoration period</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We cannot speak of a literary career for Samuel Pepys (1633 -1703), since he wrote predominantly for his own private reading. He is known for his diary which was written in a special code (Shelton’s system of tachygraphy) and was not meant to have been deciphered and read by others.  This naturally makes his account of life during the Restoration period free from prejudice and all the more authentic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The diary of Pepys is of paramount importance since it illustrates an informative and unique picture of Restoration life. It is a stunning self-portrait of the middle-class gentleman whose social position exemplifies the Restoration years of readjustment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Democracy vs Anarchy: Which one is better?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/democracy-vs-anarchy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Winston Churchill once said: “Democracy is the worst form of government except for all others.” But was he right? This article about democracy vs anarchy offers different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the years, democracy has become a defining characteristic of the West and its politics. This has even developed to a point where we are talking about &amp;ldquo;exporting&amp;rdquo; democracy to the non-Western world, falsely assuming, of course, that democracy is a perfect form of governance that enables societies to elect competent leaders through the votes of often uninformed citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Please contribute material or ideas to ensure it will be a vibrant and interesting issue. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Help us raise our banner in support of animals, who cannot speak for themselves other than with their eyes and screams; “words” most people are immune to. You could write an article, tell a story, write a poem, draw a picture… Anything that could add spice to the issue and bring the message home. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following article, written by Alex Liberto, concerns one of our Maltese members who was a victim of a ruthless mass sacking following the takeover of one company by another.  Sadly, the coronavirus has already caused havoc in the jobs market around the world, but if anyone one can suggest what UN-aligned can do to support these people, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/about/contact/&#34;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-ugly-side-to-capitalism&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another Ugly Side to Capitalism…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was the first day of December, the month of merriment and Christmas spirit. The staff at NetEnt were already planning Yuletide activities, trying to balance Covid restrictions with the desire to celebrate. They were unaware that this Christmas would be hijacked by something much more nefarious for them than Covid; the heartless stripping away of their livelihood. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Over 50 villagers, most of them women, children and elderly people were slaughtered in a rebel attack in the Oromia region at the weekend. The Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) is suspected of having carried out the barbaric attack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;03.11.20: &lt;strong&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/strong&gt;. The electoral commission confirmed President Alassane Ouattara won a disputed third term with an overwhelming majority. Most of the opposition, however, had boycotted the election. Anger at the elections spilled into the streets resulting in over 30 deaths.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 27 July 2020, UN-aligned sent a &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/letters/letter-to-mr-ashin-wirathu/&#34;&gt;letter to the Burmese Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu&lt;/a&gt; asking him, amongst other things, how he could reconcile his hostility to the Rohingya with his Buddhist creed. The letter was sent registered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Three months later, the letter is still sitting in a post office in Myanmar and the status of the letter is described as “in transit.” The address was of course correct; in fact, the monastery he resides in is the well-known and accessible New Masoyein Monastery in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandalay&#34;&gt;Mandalay&lt;/a&gt;. So why on earth is the letter still stuck in Nowhere Land?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter to UN-aligned members: Ask your government to take immediate action against the looming hunger crisis affecting millions of people worldwide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/how-to-prevent-the-food-crisis-of-2021/&#34;&gt;In a recent publication&lt;/a&gt;, UN-aligned joined the voices of organisations, like Oxfam and the WFP, in warning against a hunger catastrophe already targeting millions of children and adults in the world’s most vulnerable places. The good earth is rich and can provide for everyone and in our world of plenty, no one should have to suffer hunger or malnutrition.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solid frame-work the sustainable development goals provided during the last decade is threatened by an awful melange of disasters, such as Covid-19 and climate change. If no action is taken, many lives will be lost. Some estimates by Oxfam suggest up to 12,000 people could die every day as a result of hunger. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UN-aligned is excited to announce a new opportunity for its readers to nominate any individual or organisation whom they believe deserves more attention for championing their cause. Although the prize can go to literally anyone, we encourage you to think twice before nominating dictators, fascists or possibly your grandmother. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After we have received the final results, we will shortlist your submitted names. An appointed executive committee, who will consist of UN-aligned staff and editors of the Gordian, will decide on the final winner. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many will face horrific hunger if relief efforts are not stepped up in a world heated by coal, infected with Covid-19 and separated by nationalists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Five years ago, 193 countries lined up behind a comprehensive and ambitious set of targets – also known as the Sustainable Development Goals – to transform life and the planet by 2030. Contrary to most UN agreements that are ignored and unheeded by the member states, the project was more than a political platitude and successful on many fronts: extreme poverty fell dramatically and child deaths halved.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>5 reasons why the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize was misplaced</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 9 October 2020, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wfp.org/&#34;&gt;World Food Programme&lt;/a&gt; (WFP) was awarded the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize by the Norwegian Nobel Committee: “for its efforts to combat hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.”&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No doubt this was a safe political move since even leaders who are hostile to the United Nations, of which the WFP is a branch, cannot feel affronted by such a selection. In dangerous times, however, a safe move is often a cowardly one and, in this case, it certainly feels like one. Here are five reasons why choosing the WFP was a bad decision.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As a cofounder of UN-aligned, and representative of the organisation, I am writing to request that, in the name of human rights and international justice, you take immediate action to review your policy at the United Nations of blocking legislation, and other positive moves, to counter violence and discriminatory practices against individuals based on their sexual orientation and gender identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Islam, like most religions, has evolved, and continues to evolve, with time; just as humankind does. Nevertheless, those who do not wish to change have no right to impose their outdated views on others. In the words of Barack Obama: “Religious freedom doesn’t mean you can force others to live by your own beliefs.” As long as a person is not harming anyone else, he or she should not be victimised. This premise is essential if harmony is to flourish on earth.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I blame my bed&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For my bad back&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I blame my shoes&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For my flat feet&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I blame my wife&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Our daily strife&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I blame the heat&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For my fatigue&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I blame the cold&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For my clogged nose&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I blame them all&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For my bad traits&lt;br&gt;&#xA;It’s all their fault&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I live in hate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And when I die&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I’ll blame my God&lt;br&gt;&#xA;For a hateful life&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A painful death&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We live in a culture of litigation. We sue Starbucks if their coffee is too hot and scalds us. We sue our hosts if we get involved in an alcohol-related accident after drinking at their home. We sue teachers if our children fall and hurt themselves at school. We would sue God if we could, for making us sick, for making us unhappy, for not preventing the death of a loved one. This is the blame game. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Misgendering people: Identity and Gender Pronouns</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/culture/misgendering-people/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article does not intend to offend or devalue anyone with a non-binary gender identity. It only tries to explain why fixing misgendering is a larger problem than most people think, and why there is no immediate solution to misgendering.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-misgendering&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is misgendering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Misgendering is the act of using language to describe or talk to a person in a manner that does not align with their affirmed gender, intentionally or unintentionally. This can be in the form of personal pronouns, such as referring to someone as a ‘he’ when they’re a woman or when they do not identify with the male gender, but also through the use of gender specific nouns such as ‘boy’ and ‘girl’. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

They are directed against the EU presidency for calling their countries to task for their deteriorating record on human rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kathmandu: The Colorful Lands of Nepal - in pictures</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my life, I discovered a truthful and genuine smile in the poor areas of Nepal and India. From a distance you may only see men, women, and children who live in squatter areas or even on the streetsides, but when you get closer, you see a special kind of joy in the occasional smiles of these people. These smiles may not last forever, but when they appear, they&amp;rsquo;re as genuine as they can be. I call this the magic of Nepal and India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The competition aims to highlight the crucial link between human rights, the environment, animal welfare and the health of our ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The jury, which is composed of professional photographers, will be looking in particular for creative photos that successfully illustrate the articles of the manifesto.

      <title>Letter to Zsuzsanna Jakab: Why is it so difficult for the WHO to take a non-political approach towards Taiwan?</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/letters/letter-to-zsuzsanna-jakab/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/letters/letter-to-zsuzsanna-jakab/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Dr. Zsuzsanna Jakab, I am writing to you on behalf of UN-aligned, an international organisation that laid the foundations for an alternative United Nations, which aims to serve people, before nationstates. Although we regularly campaign for reforms to the United Nations, particularly with regards to its structure and principles, we are also involved with other issues, such as human rights, animal welfare and environmental protection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The coronavirus pandemic has become the defining global health crisis of our time and the greatest challenge we have faced since the Second World War. Since its emergence last year, the virus has spread to every continent. UN-aligned greatly admires the tireless work of the WHO and its dedication to catalysing global and national responses to this and other serious health crises. However, this pandemic has become more than an unprecedented tragedy. Recently we have received questions from our members about the relevance of the WHO’s principles and its ability to serve everyone, regardless of their country’s membership status in the United Nations. On behalf of our members we would therefore like to ask you the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Surviving against the odds: life in an overlooked Bangladeshi locality</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/country-profile/life-in-an-overlooked-bangladeshi-locality/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I live in a southernmost Upazila (administrative district) of Bangladesh called Gabura. Bangladesh is an underdeveloped country and my village is typical of the struggling communities of the delta region. Many people here do not have access to basic education and the village does not even have electricity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are three distinct seasons in Bangladesh: a hot, humid summer from March to June; a cool rainy monsoon season from June to October; and a cool dry winter from October to March. Life in Gabura changes dramatically with each season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I’d like to start a short cycle on love with a work about the “love that dare not speak its name”; the love between two men. Maurice was written by E. M. Forster back in the Edwardian England of respectability and bigotry. Not that any other period in the last few centuries were any more progressive or open minded. As Forster put it, “England has always been disinclined to accept human nature.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Immigrants: Language Acquisition and Education</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/immigrants-language-acquisition-and-education/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2020 11:02:34 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/immigrants-language-acquisition-and-education/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that immigrants make up close to 15 percent of the US population. In other countries, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025b-eng.htm&#34;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/infografik-auslaender-in-zahlen-id7040362.html&#34;&gt;Switzerland,&lt;/a&gt; this number can even rise to 20 percent. Furthermore, language proficiency is an essential factor in immigrant and refugee integration. It’s also a crucial element in increasing job opportunities, as well as social and political participation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why do some immigrants and refugees have a hard time integrating into society and what can be done about the current language education models?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;North Korea is usually in the headlines for reasons ranging from the terrifying to the bizarre. This month, their leader Kim Jong-Un is once again subject to rumours that he is dead. This is the second time since April that the speculation has emerged and been dismissed by North Korea. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Much time can be spent considering what would have to occur in order for the regime to collapse. Some speculate that the death of Kim Jong-Un could have a snowball effect on North Korea as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Considering same-sex unions date back over 12,000 years and that there are almost 200 countries in the world, this is not much of an achievement. In recent times, the first country to legalise same-sex marriage was the Netherlands. That law was passed in December 2000 and came into effect in April 1, 2001. So, even in the last few decades, progress has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is by Abdelkander, an UN-aligned member from Algeria who is on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/my-experience-with-unaligneds-language-courses/&#34;&gt;UN-aligned English Language Programme&lt;/a&gt;. He is currently living and working in Turkey.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;immigration-and-survival&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immigration and survival&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My name is Abdelkader, though I am also known as Faysal. I am from Algeria and I am 37-years-old. Like most young people, I want to have a decent life. Of course, I have dreams, but my main dream is simple: I just want an honest job. In my country, however, whether you studied or did not finish your studies, the matter will not be different, because in either case you will not get a job unless you have mediation, or you pay a bribe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A raft full of migrants who are fleeing war and famine are awaiting at the bay. What would &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picture this: you have five buttons in front of you. They are all linked to a raft full of migrants trying to get into your country. Many are fleeing war and famine, some may be simply looking for a better life, while a few may be nasty characters out for what they can get. Button 1: Destroy. Button 2: Ignore. Button 3: Repatriate. Button 4: Assist. Which would you press? Buttons one and two are more or less as deadly, while the consequences of button 3 are often not much better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When UN-aligned launched our series of campaigns, we knew that asking the big and uncomfortable questions would not lead to quick and straightforward answers. So far, we have campaigned against &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/letters/letter-to-mr-ashin-wirathu/&#34;&gt;anti-Muslim sentiment spearheaded by Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have campaigned against &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/letters/iranian-protesters-to-be-hanged/&#34;&gt;the death penalty for three young Iranian protestors&lt;/a&gt; and are preparing campaigns against the discrimination of the LGBT+ community to religious and political leaders in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, our most dedicated readers may be able to recall the first campaign of UN-aligned, which was an open letter to Amazon to discuss their cardboard packaging.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I accidentally discovered UN-aligned through a post on Facebook and then joined the community as I found it quite interesting and inspiring. I also thought that reading articles of interest, such as those relating to climate change, could help me improve my English.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was amazed about the tutor&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and wide range of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I desperately need to improve my English, I later also registered onto the English course. My tutor, Adrian, reached out to me soon after, and unexpectedly, this course turned out to be totally free! But what amazed me the most, was the tutor&amp;rsquo;s professionalism and wide range of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bhante Ashin Wirathu, I am writing to you on behalf of UN-aligned, an international organisation that focusses on the need to replace the United Nations with a more effective and principled organisation, although we also work to promote human and animal rights, as well as the welfare of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Institutionalised religion has had a sad history in a number of countries around the world owing to its bigotry and abuse of power. Many spiritual people, including some of our members, have therefore looked to Buddhism as a beacon of justice and openness. This image has been tainted over the last few years by portrayals of monks leading a crusade against the Rohingya inhabitants of Myanmar. The contradiction here reminds many people of the darkest periods of some of the leading world religions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

What is your background? Where do you live? What are some of your hobbies and things you are passionate about?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am from the westernmost part of Germany, only a bike ride away from the Netherlands. I have recently quitted my job in Berlin because I wanted to travel; unfortunately, this just happened when the Covid-19 pandemic hit us, so I decided to move back home and stay here instead. I enjoy music, being surrounded by nature, travelling and making friends.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A cathedral first, then a mosque, and later a museum. Last week, Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia became a mosque once again; an insular act for Turkey’s Erdogan to flex his political mussels and to fuel his posture of indignation and grievance.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The president knows casting cultural divides resonates with many of his support base, inside as well as outside of Turkey. He boosts his popularity and draws strength from his constant tussle with domestic and foreign foemen. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1992, two years before the war between the neighbouring Armenia and Azerbaijan ended, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), met in Helsinki and decided to chair negotiations towards a peaceful political settlement for the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The body, also known as the Minsk group, is led and co-chaired by the US, &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/russian-roulette-why-putins-referendum-victory-is-a-threat-to-humanity/&#34;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; and France with Belarus, Germany, Italy, Portugal, The Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Turkey, Armenia and Azerbaijan as participating member states. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-grim-trend&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Grim Trend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;July seems to have accelerated the grim trend that has been eroding civility and security over the last few years. The month dawned with Hong Kong finding itself stripped of many of its civil liberties. A few days later, on the 6th, President Trump formally notified the World Health Organisation that the US would be withdrawing from the organisation once the required twelve-month’s period of notice was over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Over 30 farmers were slaughtered by armed jihadists on motorcycles while they were returning home from their fields in villages in the Mopti region.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;05.07.20: &lt;strong&gt;Ethiopia&lt;/strong&gt;. The number of people killed in protests over the murder of popular political singer, Hachalu Hundessa, on June 29 rose to 156 according to a senior official.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;08.07.20: &lt;strong&gt;Ivory Coast&lt;/strong&gt;. Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly died aged 61 a few days after returning from France where he had undergone a medical check-up relating to a heart condition. He fell ill at a ministerial meeting and was rushed to hospital where he died shortly afterwards. He was the ruling party&amp;rsquo;s candidate for the October presidential election and was expected to replace the outgoing President Alassane Ouattara.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Many spiritual people, including some of our members, have therefore looked to Buddhism as a beacon of justice and openness. This image has been tainted over the last few years by portrayals of monks leading a crusade against the Rohingya inhabitants of Myanmar. The contradiction here reminds many people of the darkest periods of some of the leading world religions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday morning, a spokesman for Iran&amp;rsquo;s judiciary confirmed the death sentence of three young men who were participants in the nationwide unrest that swept across the country in November 2019. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The “November protests” started with anger over the government&amp;rsquo;s decision to increase diesel prices, and soon developed into violent clashes between police and  protestors, with many chanting slogans against the Islamic Republic. Protests also echoed concerns over an increasing assault on individual liberties by the Iranian establishment, massive corruption scandals and a dying economy in which many struggle to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Samuel Taylor Coleridge: The Supernatural Poet</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Coleridge, like Wordsworth, loved nature and together they enjoyed walking in the Lake District, in the heart of the natural surroundings. However, Coleridge also loved the supernatural. His fantastic and mysterious imagination was an infinite source of inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was this poetic process of creation that laid the foundations for the haunting scenes of &lt;em&gt;The Rime of The Ancient&lt;/em&gt; Mariner and the visionary surrealistic world of &lt;em&gt;Kubla Khan&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/Samuel-Taylor-Coleridge-KublaKhan.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Kubla Khan handwritten sketch&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The list of examples of cultural appropriation is so long that it became an activity itself to google what kind of results are given for cultural appropriation combined to any non-Western element. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have come a long way since World War I and World War II, yet we still see police forces using dangerous chemical weapons, such as tear gas, against their own civilians.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How dangerous are these chemical substances and should local police be permitted to use such weapons against people? How were these weapons used in WWI and WWII?  The following article aims to answer a few of these questions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Protestors: When is it OK to Hit them?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When is it OK to hit a protestor? Is protesting during a global pandemic a good idea?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There has rarely been any positive social changes without some form of protest. Too often the establishment is seen grappling on to power by fostering a dominant discourse from which dissident and minority views are excluded. At best, protests today are characterised as a disruption and inconvenience and, at worst, a threat to a vaguely-defined national security. Political leaders and the majority they may represent, blame these warriors of justice for lack of character and accountability, even though, ironically, those are the very flaws &lt;strong&gt;they&lt;/strong&gt; are being accused of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We will be highlighting their shortcomings and asking them to take positive steps in order to improve their undertakings in line with a fairer and safer world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

President Pierre Nkurunzizahas, who had been in power for 15 years, died aged 55 following a heart attack. He was due to step down in August. Riots following the start of his third term, five years ago, which many considered unconstitutional, resulted in 1,200 deaths and widespread violence.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;5.06.20: &lt;strong&gt;Uganda&lt;/strong&gt;. The Buganda Kingdom and local communities were in shock over a fire that destroyed one of the sacred houses at the Tombs of Buganda Kings of Kasubi.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;The period soon after childbirth poses substantial health risks for both mother and new-born infant. Yet the postpartum and postnatal period receives less attention from health care providers than pregnancy and childbirth. Models of postpartum and postnatal care have changed little since first developed a century ago. The World Health Organization (WHO) is in the process of revising and updating its guidance on postpartum and postnatal care delivered by skilled providers.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Frustration over the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police was already rising over the recent deaths of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52623151&#34;&gt;Ahmaud Arbery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html&#34;&gt;Breonna Taylor&lt;/a&gt;. These terrible events are only a few examples among the many of conflicts rooted in false judgement, prejudice and discrimination.   &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This article presents prejudice and discrimination from the perspective of social psychology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Use of Chinese Medicine in Treating Covid-19</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/health/the-use-of-chinese-medicine-in-treating-covid-19/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;China is promoting the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, and has even donated traditional Chinese medicine to a handful of countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This may all be in good will, however studies suggest that there are serious side effects to the use of traditional Chinese medicine. In a corrupt world where the responsible organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), have such strong political bounds to governmental entities, such as the Chinese Communist Party, it becomes our duty, as members of the society, to inform others on such crucial matters, especially when it could be a matter of life and death such as this one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;creation-is-rarely-green&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creation is rarely green&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The forces of creation are often seen as a trinity. In philosophy we have the Hegelian dialectic of Thesis, Antithesis and Synthesis, where the synthesis then becomes a new thesis which in turn postulates another antithesis, thus propelling evolution in a perpetual thrust forward. In religion, we have, for example, the Hindu trinity made up of Brahma (the creator), Vishnu (the preserver) and Shiva (the destroyer).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;China is lying about the coronavirus, document no.3 reveals&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;where-we-are&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where we are&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The global pandemic known as the coronavirus Pandemic started in December in Wuhan China, and as of 26th of April, 210 countries and territories have been affected by the virus, close to 3 million people have been diagnosed with the disease, and more than 200,000 people have tragically passed away of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In late January Dr. Zhong Nanshan, one of the advisors in managing the crisis in China, was asked whether he thought that the virus outbreak would be as bad as the 2003 SARS pandemic. Dr. Zhong Nanshan replied with absolute certainty that this would not be the case. He attributed this to advancements in medical sciences and the experience gathered from the SARS pandemic. The SARS outbreak in 2003 only infected around 8000 people and killed a bit over 800. At this point approximately three months have passed since that initial interview and we must ask ourselves how things ended up like this…&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are many reasons why some of us choose to set up life in a new country. The prospect offers numerous benefits, such as satisfying a yearning for exploration, self-improvement or a higher standard of living.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Living abroad is undoubtedly a highly enriching experience, it broadens your mind and provides exposure to different ways of life; it offers a more immersive language learning opportunity and your self-sufficiency will come to know no bounds as a result of having to jump through strange and complex bureaucratic hoops in a foreign language.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Popular leaders nowadays seem to owe their success to noise, aggression and self-aggrandisement. I call this the Cassius Clay syndrome. The louder they shout, the more they are respected. The more brazen they are, the more they gain trust. The more they blow their own trumpet, the more credible they appear. This is the leader of our 21st century populist culture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These loudmouths are distorted Machiavellian politicians. Distorted because the ends justified by their means are void of any political or social ideals. Their modus operandi is not based on any strategic acumen, it is improvised and opportunistic. It is sheer megalomania. They wallow in their own narcissism and arrogance, advocating an impoverished makeshift political agenda. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UN-aligned is one year old this month! The seed was sown some years ago in China and developed thanks to the dedication of like-minded people. We have gone from 22 Foundation Members to hundreds of followers from around the world: some are full members, others are subscribers, while many follow us on Facebook. To all our supporters, we wish to offer a big THANK YOU!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike most organisations, UN-aligned is, primarily, its members. We are the New United Nations and though just a drop in the ocean, for now, we will carry on growing until we will become a force to be reckoned with! Our Mission Statement and Manifesto clearly indicate what we stand for, but they are not written in stone and with your help we hope to learn and evolve so that we can bring about the change that we know will make the world more sustainable and harmonious.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So far The Gordian magazine has been presented in a PDF format sent to your email on a monthly basis. While this may have been perfect for readers who printed our magazine on traditional paper or those who used computer devices with bigger screens, such as laptops or tablets, mobile users often had to pinch and zoom on a specific section of the page in order to see a paragraph of text. For this reason, we have decided to change the way The Gordian magazine is presented for a temporary period of time. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

Dams being built by China are only part of the problem. Dredging the riverbed for sand to use in construction is causing the river to erode its banks and inhabited and cultivated areas with them.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February 2020, Russia announced that it would soon be offering a simplified and cheaper online visa application for tourists from EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you were asked to describe Russia, your immediate thoughts may be of snow, bears and vodka. Unsurprisingly, Russia does contain all of those things. Think a little more and you might settle on political tension, corruption and the mafia. Unless you had visited, you probably would not envision the long summers in a cottage surrounded by countryside, LGBT activists, or a local taxi driver cracking jokes in elementary English. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On Thursday 27th February, a British appeals court ruled that a planned expansion of Heathrow airport is unconstitutional because the planning process was not in accordance with the government&amp;rsquo;s own climate policies set out in the Paris Agreement. Lords Justice Lindblom, Singh and Haddon-Cave ruled that when setting out their support for the measures in their National Policy Statement (NPS), the government did not take adequate account of its contribution to the Paris Agreement on climate change.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Defining modern American music: The story of Ruth Crawford Seeger</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/culture/ruth-crawford-seeger-an-avant-gardist-who-defined-modern-american-music/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;From its early foundations, American music had a European character stamped on it by the American academic musical establishment, which itself was a product of the late 19th century. Before the 1870s, there was virtually no such thing as a music course at the universities; higher educational institutions were reserved for classes in science, history, and languages. Music was a pure extracurricular activity. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The rivalry between European training and indigenous American folk sources has always resonated throughout America&amp;rsquo;s history&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Women Composers in the Western Tradition</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/culture/women-composers-in-the-western-tradition/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/culture/women-composers-in-the-western-tradition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The history of western classical music has traditionally been the province of male composers making music for the aristocracy. Rather than due to nonexistence, the absence of women in the standard music histories has been the result of the common practices of musicologists of the past. First of all, many musicologists focused more on the documents of music (manuscripts, prints and treatises) than on the sociology of music. Fewer documents of the music of women or of the lower classes have remained. Second, musicologists have focused on the development of musical styles and the progressive works that engendered new genres. &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/ruth-crawford-seeger-an-avant-gardist-who-defined-modern-american-music/&#34;&gt;Most women&lt;/a&gt; were excluded from professional musical positions, which at least partly led to them entering new styles “late”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/climate-emergency/klaatu-barada-nikto/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;These words are taken from the classic 1951 film directed by Robert Wise: The Day the Earth Stood Still. The film, based on a short story by Harry Bates, is about an alien, Klaatu, who comes to earth in order to warn humanity of its pending obliteration by an interplanetary police force, unless it mends its destructive ways. The words were uttered to Gort, the robot, after Klaatu was shot. They delivered a stay of execution. Nevertheless, the film ends with the ball in earth’s court; their decision still to be made. We are now in 2020 and it seems as though many of our leaders are still hellbent on pursuing a self-destructive agenda.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;2019 was a momentous year for UN-aligned! The organisation was launched in May after years of preparation and it only took a few months to attract members from all over the world. The first months were focussed on perfecting and consolidating the website and communication structures, including the magazine and language options. We also worked on the services we provide to our members, such as the free English language courses to promote a lingua franca and the virtual library. Moreover, much energy was invested in the writing of a book that will challenge the structures and mechanisms of the United Nations; this should be ready for publication in Spring 2020. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>India’s Citizenship Amendment Bill: a Death Knell for Indian Secularism</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/indias-citizenship-amendment-bill-a-death-knell-for-indian-secularism/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/indias-citizenship-amendment-bill-a-death-knell-for-indian-secularism/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In December 2019 the Government of India, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), secccesfully amended a bill to the Citizenship Act of 1955, offering amnesty to non-Muslim illegal immigrants, who arrived in India prior to 2004. These immigrants must be able to prove that they are citizens of one of the three neighbouring countries: Pakistan, Bangladesh or Afghanistan. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h4 id=&#34;half-the-truth-is-often-a-whole-lie&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Half the truth is often a whole lie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Spokespeople of the Indian Government have repeatedly claimed that the new law intends to give sanctuary to people fleeing religious persecution. While this is certainly the case, the dubious decision to exclude Muslim refugees from Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and China; or in fact, the Hindu Tamils from Sri Lanka, raises questions about the Government’s sincerity. The timing of the bill is also not inadvertent; In August, the Assam State, located in the North-East of the country, witnessed two million of its residents left off the Citizen Register; this essentially left thousands of people, suspected of being illegal residents, in temporary camps which are housed in the state&amp;rsquo;s prisons. Modi and his Home Minister, Amit Shah, the mastermind behind the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), have been eroding and attacking the social identity of the Indian Muslim community from as early as 1992 and the CAB was undoubtedly brought forth with an intent to adversely affect the political identities of this community. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h4 id=&#34;the-enemy-within&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Enemy Within&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When Martin Luther King Jr. visited India in 1959, he paid the homage to the venerable land with these powerful words:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;“To other countries I may go as a tourist, but to India I come as a pilgrim.” Martin Luther King Jr.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Would Mr. King think differently of India if he were alive today? Probably not. The narrowminded fanaticism that is trying to drag India down is not a new phenomenon. Even if one cannot ignore it, one can always look beyond it. However, the world is not what it was 60 years ago. It is a much more dangerous place. Our efficiency in depleting the earth’s life and resources is only matched by the relentlessness of nature’s means of revenge, such as climate change or the smog that has recently been chocking Delhi.  Moreover, if we should end up fighting for whatever is left, we would be able to do so with much more devastating results. Finally, mass media have altered the way in which we communicate. Just as the Internet, for instance, helps the wise become wiser, it often has the opposite effect with fools, who become easy prey to those who would exploit them. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nuclear leaks are probably among the most horrifying accidents possible due to their long-term detrimental damage to life and environment. Eight years after the nuclear leak from Japan’s Fukushima power plant, local residents, many of whom are fishermen, are still suffering the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;dumping-the-radioactively-contaminated-water-directly-into-the-sea-in-order-to-dilute-it&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dumping the radioactively contaminated water directly into the sea in order to dilute it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tragically, they now have to face another nightmare. However, rather than being triggered by a natural disaster, like the nuclear accident was, this time, it was all caused by their government’s proposal of dumping the radioactively contaminated water directly into the sea in order to dilute it. So far, the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO), has already stored over 1 million tons of radioactive water used to cool destroyed reactors and the amount is still increasing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;national-identity&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;National Identity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Villages and towns, built on cooperation, existed long before nations did. With time, however, the need for security threaded them together like a string of pearls. Sometimes, the unification was voluntary, sometimes it was not. The necklaces became kingdoms and empires; republics even. Polities and economies began to evolve, as did religion, language and culture. The process continues to this day. Nevertheless, threats to national borders remain. These threats come from abroad, as in the case of Georgia and Ukraine, or from within, as is happening in Spain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although people are long used to the erratic twists and turns of Donald Trump, his decision to sell the Kurds down the river by withdrawing American troops from Syria caught everyone by surprise. Whether Trump was right to extricate his forces from Syria remains debatable, but just as there is rarely a good time to start international military interventions, so there is rarely a good time to discontinue them. One would have thought that Libya’s and Iraq’s ongoing atrocities would have made this clear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Culture of Subterfuge - Lest We Forget</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Lies, half truths, deceit and hypocrisy are so embedded in our society that people have become immune to them, accept them and often believe that subterfuge is a way of life. Some, indeed, revel in fake news, willingly spreading fictitious slander in jest. Others use fabricated tales of deception for more malevolent objectives, knowing too well that the pseudo facts will filter down into our social fabric. Whatever the reasons, the real fact is that we are living in an era of “alternative facts”, to quote the paradoxical claim by U.S. Counselor to President Trump, Kellyanne Conway. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year we took it upon ourselves to go through every speech of the United Nations General Assembly and brief you about the most important updates. In doing so, we got to hear some of the most bold and exciting statements from leaders around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We believe that the President of El Salvador’s speech was courageous, effective and to the point and thus, deserves the prize of the best statement of the debate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;every-forty-seconds&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every Forty Seconds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 10th September was World Mental Health Day. In this context the WHO published a flyer to raise awareness on suicide and how to help prevent it: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/mental-health/suicide/flyer-40seconds-web.pdf?sfvrsn=5ba643c_2&#34;&gt;Working Together to Prevent Suicide&lt;/a&gt;. The WHO highlights the fact that every forty seconds a life is lost to suicide. This is tragic and all the more so because so much more could be done to help, both on an individual and on a social basis. It is reassuring that the WHO is taking this problem seriously, but I object to suicide being so often linked with mental health. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A number of thorny topics were on the agenda this year. Some of the key issues included: foreign policy, trade and, of course, climate change. Let’s start with the last one shall we?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;climate-change-and-oceans&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climate change and oceans&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While world leaders gather around the table to endorse a new charter on biodiversity and renew their commitments to the Paris Agreement, the climate-denier-in-chief, Trump, didn’t feel like attending these talks. He’d rather focus on trade, he says. The Metz Charter on Biodiversity attempts to boost efforts to stop biodiversity loss and sustain life on the planet. This is certainly welcomed, but we can, and should, do more in a much faster way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, President Trump now wants to buy Greenland! An uninhabited Greek island is one thing, but the largest island in the world that is also an autonomous territory… Well! Although Greenland has been a part of Denmark for over 200 years, it has been increasingly self-governing since 1979, with only foreign affairs and defence still controlled by Denmark. The suggestion just highlights how callous and clueless the American President is. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

As a thank you we received beautiful pictures from her which we decided to publish as a bonus, showcasing Uraman Takht, a magnificent village in the west of &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/iran/&#34;&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Uraman Takht is indeed one of the wonders of what Iran has to offer. With a population of less than 3000, this village hosts the kindest and most hard-working people that I have yet seen throughout my journeys. This paradise is located in eastern part of Marivan city of Kurdistan and lies 1450 meters above sea level on the alluring heights of the Zagros mountains.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UN-aligned is slowly, but surely, taking its place in the world arena of politics. We are also increasingly being criticised by different sides of the political spectrum. We love constructive criticism as this helps us develop and refine our mission. However, most objections simply imply that UN-aligned is “too idealistic.” This should fuel us all the more and encourage us to create stronger unity amongst ourselves. Together, there is nothing to stop us from creating the basis for a true United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Six children and about 50 adults were killed and more that three times as many were badly hurt when a migrant detention centre was bombed by the forces of General Khalifa Haftar who are fighting the UN recognised government of Libya. The site had clearly been designated as a UN sanctuary, but this made no difference. The attack that took place on the early hours of Wednesday, but reports are now coming to light that people were fired on as they tried to escape the bombardment.  No surprise there. Migrants are treated as sub-human even by those who have the responsibility of attending to them. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;a-bike-campaign&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A bike campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the autumn of 2015, a young environmentalist in Arak, a city with pollution levels as staggering as those in Tehran, started a “car-free Tuesday” campaign to encourage people to commute by bike. The campaign soon turned popular with municipal authorities across the country beginning to encourage residents to ride bikes and leave their cars at home.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Women cyclists, naturally, saw an opportunity to support a good cause that everybody in Iran could agree on: clean air. They thought they could cycle like other male citizens if they respected Iran&amp;rsquo;s strict dress code, which requires women to cover their hair and body in public. The campaign was soon aborted after a group of female cyclists were detained in the western city of Marivan following criticism from the city&amp;rsquo;s Friday Prayers leader. The women were released the same day, but only after they signed pledges not to cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the global political scene is beginning to look more and more like a Theatre of the Absurd, UN-aligned has become an alternative platform for many to turn to. This is not surprising; long lasting peace and prosperity can only be achieved with the kind of values and principles that UN-aligned advocates.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last month, UN-aligned continued to grow, develop and change according to the needs of its members: we now have an exciting design for the user’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/dashboard/&#34;&gt;dashboard&lt;/a&gt; interface, a brand new logo and, finally, we are starting the creation of our own UN-aligned App.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Having rescued 53 migrants drifting off the coast of Libya on June 12, the Sea-Watch 3 was left stranded while the Italian authorities kept refusing to let her dock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;second-thoughts&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second thoughts…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After ordering an attack on Iran last week, president Trump had an after thought. How many human lives would it cost? One wonders: what amount of casualties would have made his strike acceptable? Fifty? A hundred? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;creating-a-problem&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating a problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Iranian problem is of Trump’s making. He pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, started a war of words and began imposing harsh sanctions. On top of that, Trump bullied all other nations to follow suit. A legally binding deal became powerless in the face of Trump’s financial blackmail. Of course that did not have to be the case, but few countries had the backbone to stand up to Trump’s threats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

In a referendum last November, 72% of the population had voted against allowing same-sex marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two years earlier, however, Taiwan’s supreme court had ruled that limiting the definition of marriage to couples of the opposite sex was unconstitutional. Legislators therefore backed the Government Bill, putting justice before numbers. This is real democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last Friday’s successful launch marks a new milestone in the world of politics, getting us ever closer to a world that works for and belongs to everyone. What makes this event so important is that UN-aligned doesn’t aim to make changes within our broken political systems, but aims to change the global framework itself as its primary goal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;un-aligned-is-about-peace-prosperity-and-stability&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UN-aligned is about peace, prosperity and stability&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;UN-aligned is an organisation that aims to create long lasting peace, prosperity and stability among its member states, which is not based on the self-indulgent interests of superpowers and their wealth. Instead, the plan is to make our economies, politics and people so closely interconnected that nationalistic secessionist sentiments would become both impractical and unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Any group that can be easily picked on offers the perfect target. Minorities of every sort are often chosen because of their vulnerability. Bullying them makes weak or bigoted citizens feel superior. Some of these minorities have fought back and with time secured a certain level of safety, and the protection of their human rights. Still, immigrants are often the most threatened, because they are insecure. They do not know the ropes and cannot easily fight back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is wrong with the United Nations to warrant the founding of an organisation like UN-aligned?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations (UN) is a remarkable organisation. It has achieved some outstanding results for humanity and it continues to do so. The 17 Sustainable Development Goals offer an example, amongst many, of its tireless work for the planet and its people. Despite its achievements, however, the UN is flawed. Its many failings relate to its structure, its principles and its functions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-language-and-structure-of-the-un-charter-are-engrained-in-the-post-war-world-of-1945&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The language and structure of the UN Charter are engrained in the post war world of 1945&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Those countries who had fought against the Allies are referred to as “enemy” states in the UN Charter and treated differently.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The five permanent members of the Security Council were the main victors of the Second World War. Their selection had nothing to do with fair representation or moral authority.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;One of the six organs of the UN, the Trusteeship Council is redundant. It was established to oversee the independence process of territories still occupied by colonial powers. Of course, it could have diversified and worked for oppressed people within nations, but it chose not do this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-permanent-members&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The permanent members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The privilege of the five permanent members to wield the veto (Article 27) allows for gross misjustice and abuse. IN 2015 France even tried to limit its use in cases that could lead to genocide, but their proposal was dismissed by Russia as “populist”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;bloody-motives&#34;&gt;Bloody motives!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an angel came and told me that all the world problems would be solved if I just put a few bombs around killing innocent people in mosques, synagogues, churches, market places or hotels… would I do it? Of course not. Firstly, because I do not even have the right to insult an innocent person, let alone take their life. Secondly, because it would be like asking me to believe that good is founded on evil, or harmony on hatred.
