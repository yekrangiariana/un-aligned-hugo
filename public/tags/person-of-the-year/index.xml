      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-antónio-guterres&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why António Guterres?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering UN-aligned is an organisation whose chief aim is to supplant the United Nations with a workable structure and agenda, António Guterres may seem one of the most unlikely choices for the UN-aligned Person of the Year. Nevertheless, all said and done, he too is striving for a better world order; the difference is that he is doing it from within: a losing battle, perhaps, but one that is not without its relevance and impact. He has proved to be brave and outspoken and unflinching in his support for the issues that matter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Domenico Lucano declared as UN-aligned Person of the Year</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UN-aligned has chosen Domenico Lucano as its Person of the Year 2021. The ex-mayor of the Italian town of Riace has been chosen for his vision regarding the integration of refugees into their destination of choice, while at the same time revitalising a dying town.  Riace became a showcase of prosperity and integration and was hailed in 2016 by Fortune magazine as one of the world’s 50 greatest leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the 30th September 2021, Lucano was sentenced to 13 years in prison for abetting illegal migration. His “crimes” included awarding waste collection contracts to companies that were set up to help migrants look for work and arranging a marriage of convenience to help a Nigerian woman escape prostitution and find legal work. The accusation that he enriched himself in the process, seems contrived, considering he does not even have the funds to pay for his legal fees. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Nasrin Sotoudeh is an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasrin_Sotoudeh&#34;&gt;Iranian human rights lawyer&lt;/a&gt; who has been in and out of prison since 2010 for no other reason than defending men, women and children who suffered under the oppressive Iranian regime. Her clients included opposition politicians, journalists, abused women and children, women who were arrested for not wearing the hijab and prisoners on death row for crimes they allegedly committed when they were minors. On several occasions she went on extended hunger strikes to protest against the severity of the prison regime.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UN-aligned is excited to announce a new opportunity for its readers to nominate any individual or organisation whom they believe deserves more attention for championing their cause. Although the prize can go to literally anyone, we encourage you to think twice before nominating dictators, fascists or possibly your grandmother. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After we have received the final results, we will shortlist your submitted names. An appointed executive committee, who will consist of UN-aligned staff and editors of the Gordian, will decide on the final winner. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
