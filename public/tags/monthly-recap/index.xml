      <description>&lt;p&gt;Standing by, while destructive, self-serving oligarchs destroy our planet and the international order, is not an option. UN-aligned&amp;rsquo;s warnings about the dangers of the United Nations, in particular its dominance by the Five Permanent Members of the Security Council, could have proved prophetic, had the writing not been on the wall from the very beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite some well-functioning aspects of the organisation and some remarkable people, like the Secretary General himself and the Special Rapporteur for Palestine, Francesca Albanese, who is truly outstanding, the structure of the organisation does not allow it to meet the dire challenges the world is facing in these unpresented times. We, “the people”, need to mobilise; make sure our voices are heard; we need to stand up for every citizen of this planet and the planet itself. In order to achieve this more effectively we are looking for dedicated people to join our Board and bring our mission forward according to the urgency the time demands. So, whatever your skills, please contact &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:adrian.liberto@un-aligned.org&#34;&gt;adrian.liberto@un-aligned.org&lt;/a&gt; to see how you can take on a leading role in UN-aligned and be at the forefront of our action.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The DR Congo government is grappling with disaster response and reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Scandal-engulfed President Cyril Ramaphosa, who is being investigated for serious violations and misconduct, survived a vote in parliament which could have set in motion impeachment proceedings that could have forced him out of office.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;18.12.22: &lt;strong&gt;Tunisia&lt;/strong&gt;. The electorate has given President Kais Saied a clear message by boycotting yesterday’s elections, with less than 9% turning up to vote. The President had suspended parliament on March 30, 2022 and revised the constitution in the hope that he could cling to power, a prospect that has now become more unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Deputy President William Ruto has been declared the winner of the presidential election, narrowly defeating his rival, incumbent Raila Odinga. The announcement, which was only endorsed by three of seven members of the electoral commission, was delayed as violent scenes erupted in Parliament. Odinga has yet to concede defeat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;//localhost:1313/images/Al-Shabaab-fighters.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;An Al Shabaab fighter&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Studies on the fossil of the yet unnamed dinosaur took several years since its discovery in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Despite having been restored to his position after the military coup in October last year, the move did little to restore confidence in the new military regime.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;02.01.22: &lt;strong&gt;Kenya&lt;/strong&gt;. Ground-breaking palaeontologist, conservationist and politician Richard Leakey, who unearthed evidence suggesting humankind evolved in Africa, died aged of 77.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;02.01.22: &lt;strong&gt;South Africa&lt;/strong&gt;.
