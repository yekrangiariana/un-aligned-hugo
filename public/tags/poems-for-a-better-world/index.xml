&lt;p>Silence is explicit&lt;br>
Silence is complicit&lt;br>
Complicity is violence&lt;br>
So in the violence of our silence&lt;br>
Let us take stock of our complicity &lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ii">ii&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our complicity silences truth&lt;br>
Muffles honour, rapes innocence&lt;br>
The same innocence we plead&lt;br>
Confronted by shattered delusion&lt;br>
“We didn’t know” &lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="iii">iii&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We wished to not know&lt;br>
Blinded, deafened, deadened&lt;br>
We turned away Bedecked ourselves in laurel&lt;br>
Which now turns to rue &lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="iv">iv&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our silence - yours and mine - is explicit&lt;br>
It is complicit It is violent&lt;br>
And in its complicit explicit violence&lt;br>
We too have bloodied our souls&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Ayesha-Kajee.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>“Terra Australis Incognita” &amp; “Silence” chosen as the winners of the 2021 UN-aligned poetry competition</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/culture/terra-australis-incognita-silence-chosen-as-the-winners-of-the-2021-un-aligned-poetry-competition/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 10:13:01 +0200</pubDate><author>Ariana Yekrangi</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/culture/terra-australis-incognita-silence-chosen-as-the-winners-of-the-2021-un-aligned-poetry-competition/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is with great pleasure to announce the winners of this year&amp;rsquo;s poetry competition arranged by UN-aligned.
