      <description>Harris’s defeat is no tragedy; it’s a sliver of justice, a rare rebuke from voters who refuse to reward American indifference to suffering abroad.</description>

      <description>The shooting in Pennsylvania is the fruit of the toxic tree Trump, and consecutive US administrations, have cultivated. It&#39;s time our headlines focus on what actually matters.</description>

      <description>Wealth and media backing notwithstanding, Israel&#39;s facade crumbles, losing its grip on legitimacy. Facing isolation, its existence as a recognised state teeters towards an inevitable demise.</description>

      <description>“Indian” vocational and residential schools have a long history in the United States and Canada, with each seeking to achieve the cultural extermination of indigenous peoples. Throughout the existance of these schools, an uncountable amount of sexual, verbal, and physical abuse was inflicted upon these essentially kidnapped youth.</description>

      <title>North Korea: A convenient pawn</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;North Korea is usually in the headlines for reasons ranging from the terrifying to the bizarre. This month, their leader Kim Jong-Un is once again subject to rumours that he is dead. This is the second time since April that the speculation has emerged and been dismissed by North Korea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much time can be spent considering what would have to occur in order for the regime to collapse. Some speculate that the death of Kim Jong-Un could have a snowball effect on North Korea as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Here is What Social Psychology Say About Prejudice &amp; Discrimination</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;rotests and clashes have spread across the US after the death of African-American George Floyd on May 25th 2020, in police custody. Frustration over the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police was already rising over the recent deaths of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52623151&#34;&gt;Ahmaud Arbery&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nytimes.com/article/breonna-taylor-police.html&#34;&gt;Breonna Taylor&lt;/a&gt;. These terrible events are only a few examples among the many of conflicts rooted in false judgement, prejudice and discrimination.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article presents prejudice and discrimination from the perspective of social psychology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How the recent conflicts in Syria could shape its future</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-happened&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although people are long used to the erratic twists and turns of Donald Trump, his decision to sell the Kurds down the river by withdrawing American troops from Syria caught everyone by surprise. Whether Trump was right to extricate his forces from Syria remains debatable, but just as there is rarely a good time to start international military interventions, so there is rarely a good time to discontinue them. One would have thought that Libya’s and Iraq’s ongoing atrocities would have made this clear.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump’s shopping list!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, President Trump now wants to buy Greenland! An uninhabited Greek island is one thing, but the largest island in the world that is also an autonomous territory… Well! Although Greenland has been a part of Denmark for over 200 years, it has been increasingly self-governing since 1979, with only foreign affairs and defence still controlled by Denmark. The suggestion just highlights how callous and clueless the American President is. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
