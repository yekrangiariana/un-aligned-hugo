      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following article, written by Alex Liberto, concerns one of our Maltese members who was a victim of a ruthless mass sacking following the takeover of one company by another.  Sadly, the coronavirus has already caused havoc in the jobs market around the world, but if anyone one can suggest what UN-aligned can do to support these people, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/about/contact/&#34;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;another-ugly-side-to-capitalism&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another Ugly Side to Capitalism…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday was the first day of December, the month of merriment and Christmas spirit. The staff at NetEnt were already planning Yuletide activities, trying to balance Covid restrictions with the desire to celebrate. They were unaware that this Christmas would be hijacked by something much more nefarious for them than Covid; the heartless stripping away of their livelihood. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
