      <description>Thanks for your great and timely question. Antonio Guterres recently called for “sending to the past” nuclear weapons and has said that the “world must abandon them forever”. You’ll notice such statements are without actionable steps but that’s besides the point…</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi. Why are train workers on strike? They earn more than teachers and nurses anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;✏️ &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ruby’s answer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
Dear reader,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations and many thanks for pointing out that train workers are not the only overworked and underpaid sector in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RMT union coordinated a strike - which includes not just those “greedy, overpaid” drivers who I’m sure are buzzing about inconveniencing the public, but a whole host of workers key to the British rail infrastructure, from the train cleaner to the railway lubricator.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
