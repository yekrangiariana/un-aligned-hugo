      <title>Misgendering people: Identity and Gender Pronouns</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/culture/misgendering-people/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This article does not intend to offend or devalue anyone with a non-binary gender identity. It only tries to explain why fixing misgendering is a larger problem than most people think, and why there is no immediate solution to misgendering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-misgendering&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is misgendering?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misgendering is the act of using language to describe or talk to a person in a manner that does not align with their affirmed gender, intentionally or unintentionally. This can be in the form of personal pronouns, such as referring to someone as a ‘he’ when they’re a woman or when they do not identify with the male gender, but also through the use of gender specific nouns such as ‘boy’ and ‘girl’. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>LGBTQ Rights: Zombie Democracy and Loveless Religion</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/lgbtq-rights-zombie-democracy-and-loveless-religion/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;hiding-behind-democracy&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hiding behind democracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any lover of democracy would be justified in feeling a sense of alarm when faced with such statements as “an assault on democracy…” and “a direct political attack against the democratically elected government…”, but as the Bard of Avon put it: “The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above two quotes come from Polish Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, respectively. They are directed against the EU presidency for calling their countries to task for their deteriorating record on human rights.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Unlocking Wedlock</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-slow-pace-of-same-sex-marriage&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The slow pace of same-sex marriage…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same-sex marriage is now legal in almost thirty countries in the world. Considering same-sex unions date back over 12,000 years and that there are almost 200 countries in the world, this is not much of an achievement. In recent times, the first country to legalise same-sex marriage was the Netherlands. That law was passed in December 2000 and came into effect in April 1, 2001. So, even in the last few decades, progress has been slow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Taiwan gives the world a lesson in democracy</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/taiwan-gives-the-world-a-lesson-in-democracy/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;learning-a-thing-or-two-from-taiwan&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learning a thing or two from Taiwan…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taiwan gave the world a lesson in real democracy last month when same-sex marriage was legalised in the “country“. In a referendum last November, 72% of the population had voted against allowing same-sex marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years earlier, however, Taiwan’s supreme court had ruled that limiting the definition of marriage to couples of the opposite sex was unconstitutional. Legislators therefore backed the Government Bill, putting justice before numbers. This is real democracy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
