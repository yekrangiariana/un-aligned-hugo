      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Italiano_-Il-dilemma-delle-sanzioni.pdf&#34;&gt;Read this article in Italian (Leggi questo articolo in italiano) →&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Yesterday, upon the stair,&lt;br&gt;
I met a man who wasn&amp;rsquo;t there!&lt;br&gt;
He wasn&amp;rsquo;t there again today,&lt;br&gt;
Oh how I wish he&amp;rsquo;d go away!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above quote from Hughes Mearns’ poem, &lt;em&gt;Antigonish&lt;/em&gt;, could so easily allude to sanctions. They are full of sound and fury, and yet, they signify nothing concrete, but rather an absence of something. Of course, sometimes, a lack of something can have devastating effects: if you stop my air supply, for instance, I am dead. Sanctions, however, are very limited in what they can stop, because what comes from outside one’s borders was not there in the first place, like the man upon the stair.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Update on the Ashin Wirathu Campaign</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On 27 July 2020, UN-aligned sent a &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/letters/letter-to-mr-ashin-wirathu/&#34;&gt;letter to the Burmese Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu&lt;/a&gt; asking him, amongst other things, how he could reconcile his hostility to the Rohingya with his Buddhist creed. The letter was sent registered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months later, the letter is still sitting in a post office in Myanmar and the status of the letter is described as “in transit.” The address was of course correct; in fact, the monastery he resides in is the well-known and accessible New Masoyein Monastery in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandalay&#34;&gt;Mandalay&lt;/a&gt;. So why on earth is the letter still stuck in Nowhere Land?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Letter to Ashin Wirathu: Can your monastery do anything now to restore the spirit of fraternity that should reign amongst all the residents of Myanmar?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bhante Ashin Wirathu, I am writing to you on behalf of UN-aligned, an international organisation that focusses on the need to replace the United Nations with a more effective and principled organisation, although we also work to promote human and animal rights, as well as the welfare of the planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Institutionalised religion has had a sad history in a number of countries around the world owing to its bigotry and abuse of power. Many spiritual people, including some of our members, have therefore looked to Buddhism as a beacon of justice and openness. This image has been tainted over the last few years by portrayals of monks leading a crusade against the Rohingya inhabitants of Myanmar. The contradiction here reminds many people of the darkest periods of some of the leading world religions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
