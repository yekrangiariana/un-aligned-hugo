&lt;p>&lt;em>&amp;ldquo;Yesterday, upon the stair,&lt;br>
I met a man who wasn&amp;rsquo;t there!&lt;br>
He wasn&amp;rsquo;t there again today,&lt;br>
Oh how I wish he&amp;rsquo;d go away!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The above quote from Hughes Mearns’ poem, &lt;em>Antigonish&lt;/em>, could so easily allude to sanctions. They are full of sound and fury, and yet, they signify nothing concrete, but rather an absence of something. Of course, sometimes, a lack of something can have devastating effects: if you stop my air supply, for instance, I am dead. Sanctions, however, are very limited in what they can stop, because what comes from outside one’s borders was not there in the first place, like the man upon the stair.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/United-Nations-Security-Council-03.03.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Update on the Ashin Wirathu Campaign</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/update-on-the-afshin-wirathu-campaign/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Nov 2020 07:00:51 +0200</pubDate><author>Adrian Liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/update-on-the-afshin-wirathu-campaign/</guid><description>&lt;p>On 27 July 2020, UN-aligned sent a &lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/letters/letter-to-mr-ashin-wirathu/">letter to the Burmese Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu&lt;/a> asking him, amongst other things, how he could reconcile his hostility to the Rohingya with his Buddhist creed. The letter was sent registered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Three months later, the letter is still sitting in a post office in Myanmar and the status of the letter is described as “in transit.” The address was of course correct; in fact, the monastery he resides in is the well-known and accessible New Masoyein Monastery in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandalay">Mandalay&lt;/a>. So why on earth is the letter still stuck in Nowhere Land?&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/venerable-w-crop.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Letter to Ashin Wirathu: Can your monastery do anything now to restore the spirit of fraternity that should reign amongst all the residents of Myanmar?</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/campaigns/letter-to-mr-ashin-wirathu/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 Aug 2020 11:16:18 +0300</pubDate><author>Adrian Liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/campaigns/letter-to-mr-ashin-wirathu/</guid><description>&lt;p>Bhante Ashin Wirathu, I am writing to you on behalf of UN-aligned, an international organisation that focusses on the need to replace the United Nations with a more effective and principled organisation, although we also work to promote human and animal rights, as well as the welfare of the planet.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Institutionalised religion has had a sad history in a number of countries around the world owing to its bigotry and abuse of power. Many spiritual people, including some of our members, have therefore looked to Buddhism as a beacon of justice and openness. This image has been tainted over the last few years by portrayals of monks leading a crusade against the Rohingya inhabitants of Myanmar. The contradiction here reminds many people of the darkest periods of some of the leading world religions.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Rohingya_displaced_Muslims_010-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
