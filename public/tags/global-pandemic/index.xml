At best, protests today are characterised as a disruption and inconvenience and, at worst, a threat to a vaguely-defined national security. Political leaders and the majority they may represent, blame these warriors of justice for lack of character and accountability, even though, ironically, those are the very flaws &lt;strong&gt;they&lt;/strong&gt; are being accused of.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
