This is as the G7 decides to take no action whatsoever. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>The UNHCR says that the number of refugees around the world has hit &lt;a href="https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/">a new high&lt;/a>, this is in spite of the pandemic, a time in which over 160 countries closed their borders. More than a third of those who fled abroad came from just five countries: Syria (6.7 million); Venezuela (4 million); Afghanistan (2.6 million); South Sudan (2.2 million); Myanmar (1.1 million). Many more are expected to have been displaced within Africa due to conflicts in Mozambique, Ethiopia and the Central Sahel region. &lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Pay-no-heed-to-the-hippie-UNHCR-chief-Filippo-Grandi-ignored-once-again-scaled.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
