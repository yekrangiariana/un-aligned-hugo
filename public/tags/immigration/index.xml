The ex-mayor of the Italian town of Riace has been chosen for his vision regarding the integration of refugees into their destination of choice, while at the same time revitalising a dying town.  Riace became a showcase of prosperity and integration and was hailed in 2016 by Fortune magazine as one of the world’s 50 greatest leaders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the 30th September 2021, Lucano was sentenced to 13 years in prison for abetting illegal migration. His “crimes” included awarding waste collection contracts to companies that were set up to help migrants look for work and arranging a marriage of convenience to help a Nigerian woman escape prostitution and find legal work. The accusation that he enriched himself in the process, seems contrived, considering he does not even have the funds to pay for his legal fees. &lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Domenico-Lucano-declared-as-UN-aligned-Person-of-the-Year.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>“Every day my heart squeezes with sadness and pain”: An Interview with Amna, a Syrian refugee in Lebanon’s Arsal Camp</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/interview-with-a-syrian-refugee-in-arsal-camp-lebanon/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 10:12:57 +0200</pubDate><author>Atika.Harba</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/interview-with-a-syrian-refugee-in-arsal-camp-lebanon/</guid><description>During her internship with UN-aligned, Atika Harba was asked to write about life inside the refugee camp in Lebanon.

In other countries, such as &lt;a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025b-eng.htm">Canada&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/infografik-auslaender-in-zahlen-id7040362.html">Switzerland,&lt;/a> this number can even rise to 20 percent. Furthermore, language proficiency is an essential factor in immigrant and refugee integration. It’s also a crucial element in increasing job opportunities, as well as social and political participation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why do some immigrants and refugees have a hard time integrating into society and what can be done about the current language education models?&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/7-1.jpg.webp" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Wishing to stay above the ground: immigration and survival</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/wishing-to-stay-above-the-ground/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Sep 2020 11:00:00 +0300</pubDate><author>fared.fared</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/wishing-to-stay-above-the-ground/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This article is by Abdelkander, an UN-aligned member from Algeria who is on the &lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/my-experience-with-unaligneds-language-courses/">UN-aligned English Language Programme&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>My name is Abdelkader, though I am also known as Faysal. I am from Algeria and I am 37-years-old. Like most young people, I want to have a decent life. Of course, I have dreams, but my main dream is simple: I just want an honest job. In my country, however, whether you studied or did not finish your studies, the matter will not be different, because in either case you will not get a job unless you have mediation, or you pay a bribe.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/6-1.jpg.webp" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Looking at migration in the face</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/looking-at-migration-in-the-face/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jul 2019 06:34:09 +0300</pubDate><author>Adrian Liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/looking-at-migration-in-the-face/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="it-has-not-been-a-good-week-for-refugees-but-then-again-it-never-is">&lt;strong>It has not been a good week for refugees; but then again, it never is…&lt;/strong> &lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Today’s The Guardian reports how the Lebanese government forced 5,000 refugee families to demolish their own home in order to induce them to return to Syria. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday, the captain of rescue ship Sea-Watch 3, Carola Rackete, was arrested after she forcefully docked her ship in the Italian island of  Lampedusa. Having rescued 53 migrants drifting off the coast of Libya on June 12, the Sea-Watch 3 was left stranded while the Italian authorities kept refusing to let her dock.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/f7e8a41211aedeeb17ed5e3bf0576d6d.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Demonising Immigrants</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/demonising-immigrants/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2019 06:40:41 +0300</pubDate><author>Adrian Liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/demonising-immigrants/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="picking-on-the-weakest">&lt;strong>Picking on the weakest…&lt;/strong>&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Some people just need a common enemy. Any group that can be easily picked on offers the perfect target. Minorities of every sort are often chosen because of their vulnerability. Bullying them makes weak or bigoted citizens feel superior. Some of these minorities have fought back and with time secured a certain level of safety, and the protection of their human rights. Still, immigrants are often the most threatened, because they are insecure. They do not know the ropes and cannot easily fight back.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/tumblr_nrfitz91k61txoxklo1_1280-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
