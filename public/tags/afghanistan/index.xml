      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-historical-context-afghanistans-education-system&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The historical context: Afghanistan&amp;rsquo;s education system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan is currently the only country in the world where girls are forbidden to go to school. The decision to stop women being able to access school and university by the Taliban in August 2021, has consequently denied millions of girls their fundamental right to education.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan has a complex and turbulent history and this has had undeniable consequences on its education system. The department of education was established in Afghanistan in 1913, with the goal of a national education system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week Edward Mortimer, the chief speechwriter for Kofi Annan, passed away at the age of 77. He was described as “one of the lively minds surrounding the Secretary-General, given license to think and experiment at a time when the future of the United Nations was being written anew”. We wish his friends and family our deepest condolences.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Today, however, we would like to point your attention towards a peculiar speech he made to the Oxford Union in 2017 defending why &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZm5iBZkiT8&#34;&gt;the United Nations is not a failing institution.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Who is Jean Arnault and what can he do about the Afghan peace talks?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Secretary General António Guterres appointed the Frenchman Jean Arnault as his envoy covering Afghanistan and regional issues. Mr Arnault is expected to support the negotiations and implementation of any agreements between the Taliban and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Jean Arnault is a former philosophy student with an extensive working background in United Nations missions in Asia, including Afghanistan, Europe, Latin America, and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No doubt his outstanding &lt;a href=&#34;https://cic.nyu.edu/content/jean-arnault&#34;&gt;experience&lt;/a&gt; in international diplomacy will bring a massive force behind the Afghan peace talks, and although we wish him all the best, it must be said that the UN&amp;rsquo;s political response to this conflict has been largely uninspiring. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
