      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever received a parking ticket? Most are undoubtedly familiar with this feeling of intense frustration at the sight of a small fine tucked at the base of their windshield.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, what if a minor parking ticket posed the threat of a much larger consequence? What if it meant your children would be taken out of school? What if it meant you and your family could be deported? This is the reality for thousands of illegal immigrant families living in North America.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My internship comes to an end, but my journey continues</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my internship at the UN-aligned, I did my best to convey the suffering of refugees and their lives in the camps through interviews and life in the camp. As a refugee myself, I now want to share one last story.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, I met a 23-year-old returning from work in the stone sawmills with his clothes covered in dust. He was the son of our neighbour and one of the brightest students at his university. He was forced to leave school due to forced majeure and ended up supporting his family by working in the mills.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Hidden Costs of Arizona&#39;s Hostile Stance Towards Immigrants</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The state of Arizona has been a hotspot for immigrants for many years. The US state, which shares about 600 km of border with Mexico, has become a popular destination for refugees and migrants who escape their homes searching for a better and safer life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While some advocate for mass deportations of these ‘illegal immigrants’, others argue for faster processing and greater protections for those seeking asylum or other forms of humanitarian assistance.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Journey of Immigrants in America: Experiences from Within</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For years immigration has been a controversial subject in the US. Some Americans call for harsher policies against immigration, others for a revision of immigration policies to allow for easier processing and more assistance to refugees. All in all, one after the other, governments have tried to revise these policies in hopes of appeasing the American population, but neither has been able to fully address this issue in a manner favourable to all.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A Day in Almoallem Refugee Camp</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/a-day-in-almoallem-refugee-camp/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One day, my little sister and I were studying for the high school exams, so we were all sitting very quietly. Suddenly we heard the sound of shooting near our camp; not only close, but actually in the camp. We started hearing the voices of children screaming and crying, and they all scrambled for their tents or perhaps entered a neighbour’s tent because of the fear and panic. We subconsciously put our heads to the ground and we started wondering what was going on. What are these sounds?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>“I entered the university and my heart is leaping with joy!” — An extracts from a refugee’s journal</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the days of the war in Syria, we lost our safety. We used to sleep to the sound of cannons and wake up to the sound of planes. One day, my mother asked me to go to the pharmacy near our house to buy a fever-reducing medicine for my little brother; while I was on the way back with my little sister, a shell fell in front of us. The people on the street started running to see what happened. We did not stop running until I got home, and we survived. This is one of the most difficult memories that stick in my memory and cannot be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Education of Syrian Refugees During the Coronavirus Pandemic</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to the epidemic, the refugee child was twice as likely to leave school as a non-refugee child. In Lebanon, poverty-related changes have been driven largely by inflation and poverty has increased by about 33 percentage points among the Lebanese population; the increase among Syrian refugees here, however, has increased by 55 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Children have not been able to continue their studies because of closures, but they are also constrained by a lack of educational opportunities at home and the digital divide.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What does it mean to be a Syrian refugee?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am Syrian; I think this phrase is enough to indicate that I may be in Sweden, Germany, Egypt or one of the many countries Syrians have resorted to in order to survive the tragedy inside Syria. This tragedy has left Syrians under the rubble, submerged in the Mediterranean Sea as they try to cross into Europe, or languishing in a prison under interrogation; perhaps eviscerated or eviscerating themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I Am A Syrian Refugee Who Lives In Lebanon&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Climate refugees in the modern world</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A climate refugee is someone displaced from their home because of an extreme weather event caused by climate change. This particular category of refugees is coming from all over the world to various places that are not being affected as deeply by extreme weather. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Climate change is nothing new and neither is human migration. Migration has been a huge factor in international interactions since the dawn of written history. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Global climate change however, is a relatively recent occurrence. Climate change is defined as “the increasing changes in the measures of climate over a long period of time – including precipitation, temperature, and wind patterns”. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>“My religion is myself and my nationality is my heart”: Five days inside a refugee’s diary</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During her internship with UN-aligned, Jihan Al-Assad was asked to write about her life inside the refugee camp in Lebanon. Her experiences, along with those of other refugees are published in a new series titled &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/diaries-from-refugee-camps/&#34;&gt;Diaries from Refugee Camps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wednesday-1122021&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wednesday 1/12/2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the beginning of a new month and the end of a whole year. This does not feel like the beginning of a month or a day or anything new. I am afraid because I don&amp;rsquo;t know exactly what is coming to me, and this idea is a big horror for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Disheartening revelations about the UNHCR in Lebanon — A refugee’s perspective</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/unhcr-in-lebanon/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The primary mission of the United Nations Refugee Agency, the UNHCR in Lebanon, is to provide emergency assistance to those forced to flee their homes. This is the first step towards long-term protection and rehabilitation, as well as a means to support in various sectors for refugees and asylum seekers. But how is this achieved in the current reality, especially in a country like Lebanon? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;positive-action-of-the-unhcr-in-lebanon&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Positive action of the UNHCR in Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The achievements of the UNHCR include:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-migrant-problem&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The migrant problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyone who has studied their history will know that migrations are what shaped the world as we know it today, both politically and ethnically. At times these migrations were peaceful. Often, they were predatory. At times they were gradual, spreading like an oil stain; often, they were sudden and quite alien, like a frenzied splash from a Jackson Pollock paintbrush. At times the end result was growth and a fusion of cultures; often, it was genocide. So we built walls of brick and paper to keep the undesirables out. Most of us belonged to those undesirables once, but that was a long time ago.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Still Life Without Flowers: A Glimpse Into The Arsal Refugee Camp</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, I will talk about my place of residence in one of the camps in Lebanon, Arsal, and how I was able to adapt to this difficult life, which does not resemble life at all. It is only days that pass without taste. One of the most difficult days of my life was when I was fifteen years old. My family decided that we should live In a refugee camp. At that time, misfortune and sadness overtook me, and I went into a state of depression.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Syrian Refugees Heading for Another Tough Winter</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/human-rights/syrian-refugees-heading-for-another-tough-winter/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The mere mention of the word ‘refugee’ immediately evokes scenes of pain, sadness, hardship and cold.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Syrian refugees in Lebanon seem fated to suffer in all seasons. After the summer heat they face a wave of frost and snow, with cracked tents that do not protect against cold or rain. In addition, the lack of heating, coupled with malnourished bodies, means that the coronavirus is much more of an existential threat. They suffer; just as migrants and other refugees do, whether it is on the Belarusian-Polish border or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>“Pay no heed to the hippie”: Filippo Grandi, UNHCR chief, ignored once again</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The globally displaced rose from 79.5 million in 2019 to 82.4 million by the end of 2020, a near 3 million increase. This is as the G7 decides to take no action whatsoever. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The UNHCR says that the number of refugees around the world has hit &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.unhcr.org/refugee-statistics/&#34;&gt;a new high&lt;/a&gt;, this is in spite of the pandemic, a time in which over 160 countries closed their borders. More than a third of those who fled abroad came from just five countries: Syria (6.7 million); Venezuela (4 million); Afghanistan (2.6 million); South Sudan (2.2 million); Myanmar (1.1 million). Many more are expected to have been displaced within Africa due to conflicts in Mozambique, Ethiopia and the Central Sahel region. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Immigrants: Language Acquisition and Education</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/immigrants-language-acquisition-and-education/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Sep 2020 11:02:34 +0300</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/global-issues/immigrants-language-acquisition-and-education/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is estimated that immigrants make up close to 15 percent of the US population. In other countries, such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/171025/dq171025b-eng.htm&#34;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blick.ch/news/schweiz/infografik-auslaender-in-zahlen-id7040362.html&#34;&gt;Switzerland,&lt;/a&gt; this number can even rise to 20 percent. Furthermore, language proficiency is an essential factor in immigrant and refugee integration. It’s also a crucial element in increasing job opportunities, as well as social and political participation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So why do some immigrants and refugees have a hard time integrating into society and what can be done about the current language education models?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article is by Abdelkander, an UN-aligned member from Algeria who is on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/my-experience-with-unaligneds-language-courses/&#34;&gt;UN-aligned English Language Programme&lt;/a&gt;. He is currently living and working in Turkey.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;immigration-and-survival&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Immigration and survival&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My name is Abdelkader, though I am also known as Faysal. I am from Algeria and I am 37-years-old. Like most young people, I want to have a decent life. Of course, I have dreams, but my main dream is simple: I just want an honest job. In my country, however, whether you studied or did not finish your studies, the matter will not be different, because in either case you will not get a job unless you have mediation, or you pay a bribe.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A raft full of migrants who are fleeing war and famine are awaiting at the bay. What would &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rdquo; do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Picture this: you have five buttons in front of you. They are all linked to a raft full of migrants trying to get into your country. Many are fleeing war and famine, some may be simply looking for a better life, while a few may be nasty characters out for what they can get. Button 1: Destroy. Button 2: Ignore. Button 3: Repatriate. Button 4: Assist. Which would you press? Buttons one and two are more or less as deadly, while the consequences of button 3 are often not much better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Having rescued 53 migrants drifting off the coast of Libya on June 12, the Sea-Watch 3 was left stranded while the Italian authorities kept refusing to let her dock.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Any group that can be easily picked on offers the perfect target. Minorities of every sort are often chosen because of their vulnerability. Bullying them makes weak or bigoted citizens feel superior. Some of these minorities have fought back and with time secured a certain level of safety, and the protection of their human rights. Still, immigrants are often the most threatened, because they are insecure. They do not know the ropes and cannot easily fight back.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
