&lt;p>Topics will range from international law and treaties to general crime and punishment. We will also be exploring the difference between what is legal and what is ethical, which are two very different animals. After all, most of the world’s problems today are caused by activities that are more or less legal everywhere, such as intensive animal farming, extraction and consumption of fossil fuels, suppression of human rights and exploitation. &lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Introduction-to-the-new-volume.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Support The Gordian with a Patreon subscription</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/opportunities/support-the-gordian-with-a-patreon-subscription/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 2021 17:43:50 +0200</pubDate><author>Ariana Yekrangi</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/opportunities/support-the-gordian-with-a-patreon-subscription/</guid><description>&lt;p>The Gordian Magazine is an open, independent publication that is read by hundreds of people around the world. Its main purpose has always been the creation of a platform for discussion and dissemination of knowledge; and with your support, we hope to take our game up a notch and build on this for many years to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So far we have managed to do without any financial support, however, as the organisation has grown our need for fundraising has become more and more crucial.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Donate-to-UN-aligned.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
