      <description>As Russia takes over the UN Security Council presidency, the world confronts the baffling irony of a nation, embroiled in the Ukraine war and led by a convicted war criminal, guiding an organisation entrusted with the preservation of global peace and security.</description>

      <description>The International Criminal Court&#39;s arrest warrant for Putin may be a small, symbolic step towards justice, but in a world where accountability is as dead as the dodo, it&#39;s a tune worth dancing to.</description>

      <description>Russia&#39;s permanent seat on the UN Security Council is under scrutiny like never before. What would happen if the UN decided to expel this rogue state from the Security Council? Will it lead to war, polarisation, or perhaps a new beginning for the UN?</description>

      <description>After the Soviet Union invaded Finland, the League of Nations kicked the country from its council. Why doesn&#39;t the UN do that too? Well, for all sorts of reasons, but mainly because it is bound to the moral low ground.</description>

      <description>Appeasement is giving the school bully your lunch money in order to avoid being beaten up. In politics, however, it is more like giving the school bully someone else’s lunch money, to stop them from being picked on.</description>

      <description>Ukraine is supported by many countries because it represents the right to build one&#39;s own future, in peace within the safety of their borders, without the threats of aggression. Peace, principles, justice and self determination are sacrosanct. That is why the Ukrainians do not want war. They want to live harmoniously among their own people, sharing the culture and heritage with their neighbours and the world.</description>

Of course not! And yet that is exactly what we are doing when we entrust world peace and human rights to the United Nations.</description>

      <title>Vlady Hell: Putin Strikes Again!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the August 2020 issue of The Gordian titled Russian Roulette: &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/russian-roulette-why-putins-referendum-victory-is-a-threat-to-humanity/&#34;&gt;Why Putin’s Referendum Victory is a Threat to Humanity&lt;/a&gt; we published an article cheekily called Vlad the Terrible. It listed a range of crimes committed by Putin ranging from mass murder to mass deceit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;vlad-the-terrible&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vlad the Terrible&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You play with fire and you risk getting burned; play with the devil and you end up screwed. Sadly, this is exactly what is happening to Europe and beyond now that the demon is waving his devil’s fork and even threatening nuclear destruction. The good news is not only that we have learned a lesson, but even more remarkably, that we are prepared to suffer the consequences of our mistakes and send this devil to hell!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;There has long been a link between Russian banks and the Russian Orthodox Church, so for many it came as no surprise to learn that an extraordinary new cathedral was being built in the outskirts of Moscow costing allegedly 82 Million USD. Photo by Alexia James.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Times the Russian Orthodox Church Flouted Norms of Decency</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under the former communist regime, the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) was suppressed, its properties confiscated and its followers harassed and imprisoned. This was until a Messiah came along. He promised the church fortune, a return to traditional values, a trip to simpler times when the state and church washed filth off each others’ backs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, Putin and the Russian Orthodox Church walk hand-in-hand in so many ways. From the eyes of the church he is seen as a “miracle of God”, a humble Russian worshiper who wants to put the Church at the heart of Russia’s national identity. However, the Church is not the only one who has wet dreams; what the ROC knows too well is that they must return the favour. And we all know what the price of &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/vlad-the-terrible/&#34;&gt;a deal with the devil&lt;/a&gt; is: selling your soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;North Korea is usually in the headlines for reasons ranging from the terrifying to the bizarre. This month, their leader Kim Jong-Un is once again subject to rumours that he is dead. This is the second time since April that the speculation has emerged and been dismissed by North Korea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much time can be spent considering what would have to occur in order for the regime to collapse. Some speculate that the death of Kim Jong-Un could have a snowball effect on North Korea as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;July seems to have accelerated the grim trend that has been eroding civility and security over the last few years. The month dawned with Hong Kong finding itself stripped of many of its civil liberties. A few days later, on the 6th, President Trump formally notified the World Health Organisation that the US would be withdrawing from the organisation once the required twelve-month’s period of notice was over.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The importance of accessible tourist visas to balance our perception of Russia</title>
      <link>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/accessible-russian-tourist-visas/</link>

      <guid>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/accessible-russian-tourist-visas/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In February 2020, Russia announced that it would soon be offering a simplified and cheaper online visa application for tourists from EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were asked to describe Russia, your immediate thoughts may be of snow, bears and vodka. Unsurprisingly, Russia does contain all of those things. Think a little more and you might settle on political tension, corruption and the mafia. Unless you had visited, you probably would not envision the long summers in a cottage surrounded by countryside, LGBT activists, or a local taxi driver cracking jokes in elementary English. &lt;/p&gt;</description>
