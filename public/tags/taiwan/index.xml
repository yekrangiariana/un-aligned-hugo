&lt;p>Taiwan gave the world a lesson in real democracy last month when same-sex marriage was legalised in the “country“. In a referendum last November, 72% of the population had voted against allowing same-sex marriage.&lt;/p>

Legislators therefore backed the Government Bill, putting justice before numbers. This is real democracy.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/architecture-buildings-city-1933566.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
