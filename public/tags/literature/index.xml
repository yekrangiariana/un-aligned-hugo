      <description>&lt;p&gt;After our overview of post-war British drama with a survey of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFPD3yGlnWubBApVyOyjFgWhXeP1qBShaTKmbLeM_8I/edit#&#34;&gt;Theatre of the Absurd&lt;/a&gt;, let us now look at another important literary movement that developed after the end of World War II. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The end of the war left a sense of discontent and disillusionment, especially with the younger generation. As society developed into a more affluent capitalistic and class-conscious structure, the younger generation became aware that the poorer classes were being exploited and this prompted them to voice their anger. A new class of writers, known as the Angry Young Men, came into being. They were expressing their anger through various literary genres, in particular through prose and drama.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the last issue we saw how Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/samuel-beckett-harold-pinter-two-giants-of-the-theatre-of-the-absurd/&#34;&gt;developed a new drama&lt;/a&gt; that was characterized by features that had nothing in common with the prevailing criteria of the time: the Theatre of the Absurd. In this issue we shall take a closer look at Nobel Prize winner Harold Pinter, one of the most influential modern British dramatists with a writing career spanning over more than 50 years.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i&#34;&gt;i&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence is explicit&lt;br&gt;
Silence is complicit&lt;br&gt;
Complicity is violence&lt;br&gt;
So in the violence of our silence&lt;br&gt;
Let us take stock of our complicity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;ii&#34;&gt;ii&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our complicity silences truth&lt;br&gt;
Muffles honour, rapes innocence&lt;br&gt;
The same innocence we plead&lt;br&gt;
Confronted by shattered delusion&lt;br&gt;
“We didn’t know” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iii&#34;&gt;iii&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We wished to not know&lt;br&gt;
Blinded, deafened, deadened&lt;br&gt;
We turned away Bedecked ourselves in laurel&lt;br&gt;
Which now turns to rue &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;iv&#34;&gt;iv&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our silence - yours and mine - is explicit&lt;br&gt;
It is complicit It is violent&lt;br&gt;
And in its complicit explicit violence&lt;br&gt;
We too have bloodied our souls&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is with great pleasure to announce the winners of this year&amp;rsquo;s poetry competition arranged by UN-aligned. This year, we have received 17 poems that creatively portrayed the values that UN-aligned’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/&#34;&gt;Manifesto&lt;/a&gt; campaigns for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The first place&lt;/strong&gt; goes to Dean Gessie from Canada for his poem “&lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/terra-australis-incognita/&#34;&gt;Terra Australis Incognita&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And the &lt;strong&gt;second place&lt;/strong&gt; goes to Ayesha Kajee from South Africa for her poem “&lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/silence/&#34;&gt;Silence&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The selection in the call for works was made by UN-aligned’s literary editor and winner of the international ‘Il Leone D’Oro’ award, &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/author/alex-liberto/&#34;&gt;Alex Liberto&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/literature/&#34;&gt;the last issue&lt;/a&gt; we saw how some 20th century writers envisioned &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-dystopian-novel-beyond-utopia/&#34;&gt;a dystopian future&lt;/a&gt; in reaction to the two world wars and to the dwindling human values. Protesting against society and the situation of man, but in a different way, were the giants of the Theatre of the Absurd Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter. Both playwrights developed a new drama which was characterised by features that had nothing in common with the prevailing criteria of the time. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Dystopian Novel: &#34;Beyond Utopia&#34;!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The dystopian novel developed during the 20th century when the reality of humanity’s volatile condition became evident after both the first and second world wars. The word, dystopia, refers to Utopia, the fictitious name of an ideal country, coined by Thomas More in his famous book Libellus &amp;hellip; de optimo reipublicae statu deque nova Insula &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2130&#34;&gt;Utopia (1516)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was designed as a political, social and religious system which was not supposed to be reflected in reality, but proposed as an ideal model.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The situation that plagued the world after World War One was one of callous apathy and emotional aridity. My last article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/your-guide-to-t-s-eliot-poems/&#34;&gt;T. S. Eliot’s poetic portrayal of the early 20th century&lt;/a&gt; ended with the line, “The dehumanisation of the modern world is complete.” This ‘dehumanisation’, which Eliot portrayed as a waste land in his poetry, was also described very clearly in prose by F. S. Fitzgerald in his novel &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following article is taken from a speech given by Carla Pietrobattista on Dante Day, March 25, which is traditionally held as the day the “divine poet” started his masterpiece, the &lt;em&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/em&gt;. 2021 also marks the 700th anniversary of Dante’s death. The event was presided by the Mayor of Magliano dei Marsi, Pasqualino di Cristofano. Ms. Pietrobattista will also be collaborating on the new Art Section of &lt;em&gt;The Gordian&lt;/em&gt;, which will start next month.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Your guide to T.S Eliot poems - April is the cruellest month</title>
      <link>/culture/your-guide-to-t-s-eliot-poems/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;T.S Eliot is perhaps the best example of the modern metaphysical poet. Like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/john-donne-life-career-and-poems/&#34;&gt;17th century poet, John Donne&lt;/a&gt;, Eliot veered from the ethereal world of romance and idealisation, to head directly towards a concrete reality through conceits and extended metaphors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His work reflected the upheaval of the social order in the aftermath of World War I, and the failure of all of man’s social, political and philosophical aspirations. On the wake of death and destruction, all seemed to flounder on the crags of a festering humanity that had turned to superficial desires and material gain. Ethical and moral values were reduced to a vast expanse of ash and aridity; a waste land void of any humanity. Humankind had lost its soul.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
