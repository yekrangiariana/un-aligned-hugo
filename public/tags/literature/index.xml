&lt;p>The end of the war left a sense of discontent and disillusionment, especially with the younger generation. As society developed into a more affluent capitalistic and class-conscious structure, the younger generation became aware that the poorer classes were being exploited and this prompted them to voice their anger. A new class of writers, known as the Angry Young Men, came into being. They were expressing their anger through various literary genres, in particular through prose and drama.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Photo-John-Osbornes-Wikipedia-page..jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Harold Pinter: a mirror for the common people</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/culture/harold-pinter-a-mirror-for-the-common-people/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Nov 2021 12:50:05 +0200</pubDate><author>alex.liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/culture/harold-pinter-a-mirror-for-the-common-people/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the last issue we saw how Samuel Beckett and Harold Pinter &lt;a href="https://un-aligned.org/culture/samuel-beckett-harold-pinter-two-giants-of-the-theatre-of-the-absurd/">developed a new drama&lt;/a> that was characterized by features that had nothing in common with the prevailing criteria of the time: the Theatre of the Absurd.

&lt;p>Silence is explicit&lt;br>
Silence is complicit&lt;br>
Complicity is violence&lt;br>
So in the violence of our silence&lt;br>
Let us take stock of our complicity &lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ii">ii&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our complicity silences truth&lt;br>
Muffles honour, rapes innocence&lt;br>
The same innocence we plead&lt;br>
Confronted by shattered delusion&lt;br>
“We didn’t know” &lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="iii">iii&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We wished to not know&lt;br>
Blinded, deafened, deadened&lt;br>
We turned away Bedecked ourselves in laurel&lt;br>
Which now turns to rue &lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="iv">iv&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Our silence - yours and mine - is explicit&lt;br>
It is complicit It is violent&lt;br>
And in its complicit explicit violence&lt;br>
We too have bloodied our souls&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Ayesha-Kajee.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>“Terra Australis Incognita” &amp; “Silence” chosen as the winners of the 2021 UN-aligned poetry competition</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/culture/terra-australis-incognita-silence-chosen-as-the-winners-of-the-2021-un-aligned-poetry-competition/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 10:13:01 +0200</pubDate><author>Ariana Yekrangi</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/culture/terra-australis-incognita-silence-chosen-as-the-winners-of-the-2021-un-aligned-poetry-competition/</guid><description>&lt;p>It is with great pleasure to announce the winners of this year&amp;rsquo;s poetry competition arranged by UN-aligned.

&lt;p>His work reflected the upheaval of the social order in the aftermath of World War I, and the failure of all of man’s social, political and philosophical aspirations. On the wake of death and destruction, all seemed to flounder on the crags of a festering humanity that had turned to superficial desires and material gain. Ethical and moral values were reduced to a vast expanse of ash and aridity; a waste land void of any humanity. Humankind had lost its soul.&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/T.S-Eliot-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item></channel></rss>
