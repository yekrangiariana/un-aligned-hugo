      <description>&lt;p&gt;Following a successful AGM, during which Adrian Liberto was confirmed as Chair and Partho Chatterjee as Vice-Chair, UN-aligned would like to highlight some of the priorities for the remainder of 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our first priority is to bolster our membership board with dedicated members who can propel the organisation forward. The mission remains the same: the creation of a united nations that is fit for purpose, supported by inviolable values, rather than subservience to the self-interest of dominant member-states. This we are now prepared to do in collaboration with those sectors of the current United Nations that are not compromised beyond redemption. Â &lt;/p&gt;</description>
