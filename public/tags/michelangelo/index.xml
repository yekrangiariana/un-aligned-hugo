      <description>&lt;p&gt;My cultural background and my personal tastes have always made my interests oscillate (also for the purposes of research and study) between figurative and written art. There is a topic that thanks to certain dynamics of realisation and conception, allows me to combine these two main fields of interest in a single analysis: graffiti. In fact, in this &amp;ldquo;category&amp;rdquo;, the testimonies on the wall and the writing often merge into a single genre.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doni Tondo, a renowned artwork by Michelangelo, has long been a source of inspiration for art enthusiasts and critics alike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for me, this masterpiece holds a deeper significance, evoking a sense of personal validation and ego boost. Join me in exploring the depths of Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s Doni Tondo as we analyse its style and history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-was-the-doni-tondo-painted&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When was the Doni Tondo painted&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Doni Tondo, a masterpiece created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/michelangelo/&#34;&gt;Michelangelo Buonarroti,&lt;/a&gt; was painted between 1505 and 1507. Despite being a young artist at the time, Michelangelo had already achieved significant success with his earlier works, earning widespread praise from patrons and the public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The last judgement of Michelangelo Buonarroti</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how the mind and hands of artists make abstract and elusive concepts visible. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about all those stories whose origins are lost in the mists of time: mythological stories, religious testimonies, legends, which although familiar in terms of knowledge, lack a real visual concreteness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The images chosen by artists to convey their thoughts, their inspiration regarding these stories, become something possible, even real, for us observers. Perhaps it is thanks to these numerous testimonies that have always accompanied us in a more or less conscious way that concepts that are difficult to understand, as they are far from our daily life, become less cryptic and even, as already mentioned, familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Like Rings in The Water: Dante’s impact on Michelangelo</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a stone is thrown into the water, the greater the power of the blow, the greater the number of circles produced on the surface. The image of these circles that indicate the passage of the stone in the water, is the symbol that most represents the power of art. In fact, creating a work of art means launching a message whose strength, just like that of a stone, cannot be confined to falling silently into the consciousness of the recipients of the art itself; the impact must generate waves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Perfected Thought: Michelangelo Buonarroti</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/culture/the-perfected-thought-michelangelo-buonarroti/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The search for perfection, albeit in different ways and forms, has always accompanied man throughout his growth and impacted his socio-historical imprint . Starting from ideas for the improvement and evolution of the most basic aspects of life, such as the perfecting of agricultural or construction techniques, his ambition  stretched to the creation of increasingly perfect buildings and works of art. Although there is no universal concept of absolute perfection, because every judgment or perception of beauty is inevitably conditioned by its own yardstick, I find that everyone in art, in any form of art, can find or express their own idea of ​​perfection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
