&lt;p>One of the greatest escapes for children growing up against the backdrop of war and famine is in their creative imaginations. The power of pretend is brilliantly articulated by children in games where they explore and adventure in the unforgiving rubble and debris of their war-torn communities. &lt;/p>

This needs to change. Meet the new lady justice!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="lady-justice">&lt;strong>Lady Justice&lt;/strong>&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Have you ever wondered why representations of Lady Justice depict her in a blindfold? The accepted explanation is that the blindfold symbolises impartiality. Lady Justice is supposed to be oblivious to power, status, wealth or any other privilege. She also sports scales, which represent fairness through the weighing up of the facts, and a sword, which represents swift and thorough retribution. Although the scales date back to her earliest manifestations as the Egyptian goddess Maat, the blindfold probably originated with Hans Gieng’s 1543 Gerechtigkeitsbrunnen (Fountain of Justice) in the Old City of Bern. Despite the accepted wisdom, however, one cannot help comparing the blindfold to that of “blind” Fortune, whose largess is purely random. How else can there be so much injustice in the world?&lt;/p></description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/The-new-lady-justice.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Gutterres' visit to Ukraine: Another blow to the UN</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/un-in-focus/gutterres-visit-to-ukraine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2022 10:00:00 +0300</pubDate><author>Adrian Liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/un-in-focus/gutterres-visit-to-ukraine/</guid><description>Guterres visit to Kiev made it once again clear: the UN is not led by principles, but by States that regularly flout the most basic standards of decency.</description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Gutterres-and-Zelensky.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>Letter to Putin: “You are a serial killer, but there is one thing I must thank you for…”</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/letter-to-putin/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2022 10:00:00 +0300</pubDate><author>Adrian Liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/letter-to-putin/</guid><description>Putin, sometimes the West is as crazy as you are, but not for saying you should be removed, but for trying to mitigate the blow.</description><enclosure url="https://un-aligned.org/images/Letter-to-Putin.jpg" type="image/jpeg"/></item><item><title>It shouldn't be NATO, it should be the United Nations: The Poetry of Appeasement</title><link>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/it-should-not-be-nato-it-should-be-the-united-nations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2022 11:00:00 +0300</pubDate><author>Adrian Liberto</author><guid>https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/it-should-not-be-nato-it-should-be-the-united-nations/</guid><description>Once again, the UN fails to secure its primary mission of safeguarding world peace.
