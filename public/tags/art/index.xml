      <title>How Michelangelo’s &#34;Fruit Basket&#34; captures the fleeting essence of life</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always postponed examining the canvas: the &amp;ldquo;Fruit Basket&amp;rdquo; for various, and undoubtedly futile, reasons. The first and foremost relates to the subjects, or rather objects to be examined. In fact, the absence of any human presence seemed to me to be an almost insurmountable hurdle in my search for feelings, in contrast to the various subjects depicted by &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/caravaggio/&#34;&gt;Caravaggio in his other works&lt;/a&gt;. Moreover, the setting of the canvas also initially blocked me, because it lacked the obvious theatricality of Merisi&amp;rsquo;s Roman works.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How Caravaggio&#39;s &#39;The Burial of Saint Lucy&#39; Transforms the Divine into the Earthly</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;breaking-from-iconic-traditions&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking from iconic traditions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both artistic and sculptural representations traditionally depict St. Lucy in celestial grandeur. She is often shown holding the palm of her martyrdom, which occurred in Syracuse in 304, in one hand, and a saucer containing her eyes in the other.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This iconographic element is a nod to her role as the protector of sight, although it bears no relation to the martyrdom she endured. The origin of this specific veneration is tied to her name: Lucy, or Lucia, derives from the Latin term &amp;rsquo;lux,&amp;rsquo; meaning light—an element naturally associated with eyesight.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>&#39;Transcending Strokes&#39;: Caravaggio&#39;s Unmistakable Emotion in &#34;Judith and Holofernes&#34;</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The repetition of distinctive stylistic elements helps art scholars, when necessary, to identify and recognise the authors. In the case of Caravaggio, the most frequent distinctive elements are different: the stroke of the drawing; the choice of the same models for the various characters; the way of interpreting the colours; the contrast between shadow and light…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet what in my eyes makes Caravaggio&amp;rsquo;s hand truly unmistakable, even more than the presence of these objective stylistic elements, is the emotional tension that shines through the faces of the characters who, in most cases, tell us about the eternal conflict between good and evil that has always accompanied man.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sculpting Change: Two Women Reshaping Iran&#39;s Pottery Scene</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The whirling hum of the spinning wheel, the rhythm of skilled hands modelling shapeless clay and the mesmerising transformation in the kiln: the world of pottery is one of patience, resilience and creativity. And within this sphere in Iran, two exceptional women, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/samirghafori/?img_index=1&#34;&gt;Samira Ghafori&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.instagram.com/anna_clayart/?img_index=1&#34;&gt;Anahita Ahmadi,&lt;/a&gt; are shaping more than just clay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Samira, an artist who started young, had her destiny intertwined with pottery before she even knew it. Her early fascination with the craft was born out of playful experimentation that evolved into a lifelong commitment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Caravaggio&#39;s Crucifixion of St. Peter: The Unseen Heroism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My fixation with Caravaggio is one that prompts me to continually seek avenues to discuss his work. The necessity to scrutinise the Crucifixion of St. Peter, residing in the Cerasi Chapel, provides a convenient pretext. This painting, like &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-conversion-of-st-paul-by-caravaggio-a-masterpiece-of-dramatic-intensity-and-transformative-power/&#34;&gt;the Conversion of St. Paul,&lt;/a&gt; was crafted for the same patron.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet, the underlying motivation is less about circumstance and more about an earnest fascination with Caravaggio&amp;rsquo;s life and artistic creations, even though the root of this allure remains elusive.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-meaning-of-conversion-and-its-relevance-to-the-painting&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Meaning of ‘Conversion’ and Its Relevance to the Painting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;lsquo;conversion&amp;rsquo; is derived from the Latin word &amp;lsquo;conversio&amp;rsquo;, which denotes a movement from one place to another, a turning towards something or someone, or a change of direction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Although the word itself does not necessarily connote any religious or moral significance, it presents boundless possibilities for internal and external transformation. Change can happen by deliberate choice or can be brought about unexpectedly by life&amp;rsquo;s unpredictable events, which often add new shades and dimensions to our existence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you scrolled through Instagram recently, did you stumble across pieces of digital artwork that looked like it was custom-made for the user? The chances are, it was generated by an AI using a trendy new app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Lensa is just one of many apps that have recently gained popularity, allowing users to generate portraits, illustrations and other types of artwork at the click of a button. But while these AI-powered tools can produce impressive results, they have also sparked a debate about the implications of using AI to create art.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Over time, I have learned that when it comes to art it is not necessary to be original at all costs, I simply understood that I have to write what I think, in the way and in the times that most belong to me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I certainly would not try to be original and captivating during Christmas, a time that most of all tells us about traditions and the need to go back to basics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of Giovanni Paolo Pietrobattista, although chronologically distant, are incredibly close, because their protagonist was my great uncle. Despite never having met Giovanni Paolol, he is very dear to me thanks to the stories my grandmother and my father have shared with me. Nor only have they instilled in me admiration for what my uncle had been able to achieve, but also a strong affection and empathy towards him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Caravaggio and the unveiling of truth</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/culture/caravaggio-and-the-unveiling-of-truth/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each of us is constantly torn between comfortable facade truths, and those deep and real truths that sometimes elude us. For most people, it is relatively easy to keep the uncomfortable aspects of authentic truths hidden. In the case of artists, on the other hand, especially the best known ones, this secrecy is lost because their lives, and their works, are often under the lens of historical and stylistic research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My cultural background and my personal tastes have always made my interests oscillate (also for the purposes of research and study) between figurative and written art. There is a topic that thanks to certain dynamics of realisation and conception, allows me to combine these two main fields of interest in a single analysis: graffiti. In fact, in this &amp;ldquo;category&amp;rdquo;, the testimonies on the wall and the writing often merge into a single genre.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Doni Tondo: A Visual Analysis of Michelangelo&#39;s Masterpiece</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Doni Tondo, a renowned artwork by Michelangelo, has long been a source of inspiration for art enthusiasts and critics alike.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But for me, this masterpiece holds a deeper significance, evoking a sense of personal validation and ego boost. Join me in exploring the depths of Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s Doni Tondo as we analyse its style and history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;when-was-the-doni-tondo-painted&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When was the Doni Tondo painted&lt;/strong&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Doni Tondo, a masterpiece created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/tag/michelangelo/&#34;&gt;Michelangelo Buonarroti,&lt;/a&gt; was painted between 1505 and 1507. Despite being a young artist at the time, Michelangelo had already achieved significant success with his earlier works, earning widespread praise from patrons and the public.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The last judgement of Michelangelo Buonarroti</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is amazing how the mind and hands of artists make abstract and elusive concepts visible. I&amp;rsquo;m talking about all those stories whose origins are lost in the mists of time: mythological stories, religious testimonies, legends, which although familiar in terms of knowledge, lack a real visual concreteness.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The images chosen by artists to convey their thoughts, their inspiration regarding these stories, become something possible, even real, for us observers. Perhaps it is thanks to these numerous testimonies that have always accompanied us in a more or less conscious way that concepts that are difficult to understand, as they are far from our daily life, become less cryptic and even, as already mentioned, familiar.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When a stone is thrown into the water, the greater the power of the blow, the greater the number of circles produced on the surface. The image of these circles that indicate the passage of the stone in the water, is the symbol that most represents the power of art. In fact, creating a work of art means launching a message whose strength, just like that of a stone, cannot be confined to falling silently into the consciousness of the recipients of the art itself; the impact must generate waves.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are living in a difficult historical moment, in which each of us, myself included, in a more or less &amp;ldquo;blatant&amp;rdquo; way, has had the need to talk about covid. In this article, however, I would like to describe how covid spoke to me. Fortunately, I have not experienced the disease, but I have certainly experienced all the restrictions associated with it in a conscious way. The silence and being at home awakened in me memories: images and situations from the past that everyday life had made me put aside. With a different and certainly more mature awareness, I was able to clearly define what is important to me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

During the month of December we were constantly bombarded with images that create romantic and idealised suggestions. Despite the decidedly muffled atmosphere, I will try to talk with you about the nativity in art trying to maintain a critical, attentive and open attitude.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Artemisia, also known as the mugwort flower, is a symbol of gratitude, the leaves of the plant give energy and certainly have nothing to do with addiction to absinthe, a substance obtained from them, which generates addiction when associated with alcoholic substances. Gratitude is the feeling that each of us should have towards every artist. Here, we can also grasp the energy and strength in art through historical information referable to a great woman and artist: Artemisia Gentileschi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have yet reached my own style in writing and I don&amp;rsquo;t even think I want to reach it so as not to end up entangled in webs created by myself. I do not love to rely on chance, but do enjoy spontaneous and sudden thoughts. Precisely for this reason, following what came to my mind as soon as I delivered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/when-art-is-mystery-the-sculpture-of-the-veiled-christ/&#34;&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to continue talking about freedom of expression in art, just as I had already done when talking about &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/the-perfected-thought-michelangelo-buonarroti/&#34;&gt;Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s Pietà Rondanini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If talking about what you don&amp;rsquo;t know well is frightening, trying to convey to others what you have studied for a long time with enthusiasm and passion is disorienting, because you proceed with the constant feeling of not saying everything or at least not saying enough.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I was still a university student, I was deeply impressed by Christian archeology not only as a matter of faith, but because when art is placed at the service of any kind of religion or religious thought, it generates artistic phenomena that involve social edification. Among the various topics covered during the lessons, one in particular remained with me: the tituli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Perfected Thought: Michelangelo Buonarroti</title>
      <link>//localhost:1313/culture/the-perfected-thought-michelangelo-buonarroti/</link>

      <guid>//localhost:1313/culture/the-perfected-thought-michelangelo-buonarroti/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The search for perfection, albeit in different ways and forms, has always accompanied man throughout his growth and impacted his socio-historical imprint . Starting from ideas for the improvement and evolution of the most basic aspects of life, such as the perfecting of agricultural or construction techniques, his ambition  stretched to the creation of increasingly perfect buildings and works of art. Although there is no universal concept of absolute perfection, because every judgment or perception of beauty is inevitably conditioned by its own yardstick, I find that everyone in art, in any form of art, can find or express their own idea of ​​perfection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
