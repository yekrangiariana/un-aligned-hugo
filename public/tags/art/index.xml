      <description>&lt;p&gt;Each of us is constantly torn between comfortable facade truths, and those deep and real truths that sometimes elude us. For most people, it is relatively easy to keep the uncomfortable aspects of authentic truths hidden. In the case of artists, on the other hand, especially the best known ones, this secrecy is lost because their lives, and their works, are often under the lens of historical and stylistic research.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Artemisia, also known as the mugwort flower, is a symbol of gratitude, the leaves of the plant give energy and certainly have nothing to do with addiction to absinthe, a substance obtained from them, which generates addiction when associated with alcoholic substances. Gratitude is the feeling that each of us should have towards every artist. Here, we can also grasp the energy and strength in art through historical information referable to a great woman and artist: Artemisia Gentileschi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think I have yet reached my own style in writing and I don&amp;rsquo;t even think I want to reach it so as not to end up entangled in webs created by myself. I do not love to rely on chance, but do enjoy spontaneous and sudden thoughts. Precisely for this reason, following what came to my mind as soon as I delivered the &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/when-art-is-mystery-the-sculpture-of-the-veiled-christ/&#34;&gt;last article&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to continue talking about freedom of expression in art, just as I had already done when talking about &lt;a href=&#34;https://un-aligned.org/culture/the-perfected-thought-michelangelo-buonarroti/&#34;&gt;Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s Pietà Rondanini&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If talking about what you don&amp;rsquo;t know well is frightening, trying to convey to others what you have studied for a long time with enthusiasm and passion is disorienting, because you proceed with the constant feeling of not saying everything or at least not saying enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when I was still a university student, I was deeply impressed by Christian archeology not only as a matter of faith, but because when art is placed at the service of any kind of religion or religious thought, it generates artistic phenomena that involve social edification. Among the various topics covered during the lessons, one in particular remained with me: the tituli.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The search for perfection, albeit in different ways and forms, has always accompanied man throughout his growth and impacted his socio-historical imprint . Starting from ideas for the improvement and evolution of the most basic aspects of life, such as the perfecting of agricultural or construction techniques, his ambition  stretched to the creation of increasingly perfect buildings and works of art. Although there is no universal concept of absolute perfection, because every judgment or perception of beauty is inevitably conditioned by its own yardstick, I find that everyone in art, in any form of art, can find or express their own idea of ​​perfection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
