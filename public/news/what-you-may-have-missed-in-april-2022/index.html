Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch joined forces to conduct an investigation into abuses in the Tigray Region by the Federal Government particularly through the Amhara Region special forces.

Former president Blaise Compaoré was found guilty by a military court over his role in the 1987 murder of his predecessor, revolutionary icon, Thomas Sankara.

The gunmen who abducted passengers on the Abuja-Kaduna train on Monday released a video in which they threatened to kill all their hostages: ‘’Government should hasten to meet us before we turn this place into an abattoir, because killing these people is nothing to us.” They claim to have taken 168 people, although the rail corporation says that 141 are unaccounted for.</p><p>08.04.22: <strong>Burkina Faso</strong>.

He died in early March, but his family were only informed this weekend when they were asked to collect his body.</p><p>12.04.22: <strong>South Africa</strong>. Heavy floods and mudslides in the Durban area have caused dozens of deaths and widespread devastation. <strong>18.04.22</strong>: The death toll of the ongoing floods has surpassed 400 people.</p><p>12.04.22. <strong>D. R. Congo</strong>. The Red Cross has said that at least 30 people have been brutally slaughtered during two days of attacks by gunmen in Ituri Province.

Right wing Rodrigo Chaves Robles, a former finance minister and World Bank official, has won the presidential election and will take over from President Carlos Alvarado Quesada on May 8, 2022.

Populist President Aleksandar Vučić has secured a second term in office by comfortably winning the presidential election. Though he has mellowed with time, his legacy is a divisive one.

President Maia Sandu convened a special security meeting following a number of blasts at strategic sites in the breakaway pro-Russian region of Transnistria. The explosions are thought to be part of a ploy by Moscow to generate a pretext for occupation.</p><h2 id=asia><strong>ASIA</strong></h2><p>02.04.22**: Sri Lanka**. In the wake of mass protests triggered by rising prices and food shortages, the government has imposed a 36-hour curfew from Saturday evening to Monday morning; this is on the back of a state of emergency which was declared yesterday. Social media has also been blocked.</p><p>03.04.22: <strong>Sri Lanka</strong>.
