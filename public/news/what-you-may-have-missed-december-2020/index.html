The centre-left politician was diagnosed with cancer towards the end of his last term.</p><p>09.12.20: <strong>USA</strong>. The Senate voted in favour of President Trump’s high-tech weapons deals with the United Arab Emirates despite a motion to block it. The president threatened to use his veto if it was not approved.  President Elect Biden is expected to review the deal when he takes office in January.

They were opposed to a link between payments and the upholding of the rule of law. The compromise was brokered by Germany and included a reassurance that “national identity” would be respected. Whilst this made little difference, many felt that the EU should not have allowed itself to be blackmailed in this way. Writing in <em>La Republica</em> (It), journalist Timothy Garton Ash echoed this opinion: “It is hard to say which is now the greater danger to the future of the EU: a democratic Britain that has left, or an undemocratic Hungary that remains.”</p><p>12.12.20: <strong>UK</strong>.
