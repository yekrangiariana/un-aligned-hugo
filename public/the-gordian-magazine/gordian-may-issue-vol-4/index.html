More often than not, human justice is just a sinister doppelg√§nger of justice in its purest form. Human justice depends on laws, and as we all know, laws are biased. In this issue of¬†The Gordian,¬†we discuss the differences between the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court and test their fairness, validity and integrity. We will also introduce you to a new series within magazine¬†titled¬†&#34;UN in Focus&#34;. This issue contains exclusive reports by Jonna Lappalainen, Ayten Aydin and¬†Carla Pietrobattista.</p>

<p><em>By Ariana Yekrangi</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/Updates-to-the-UN-aligned-manifesto-that-you-need-to-review-1024x614.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>On May 2021, UN-aligned board decided to update the language around some of the items in its manifesto. You can review all the edits here.</p>
<p>We believe the flexible roadmap of UN-aligned‚Äôs manifesto presents a safe trajectory for a united world, so as UN-aligned grows we are always seeking to refine, clarify and improve our goals and missions. The following changes have been made to the UN-aligned manifesto as of May 2021.</p>
<h3 id="updates-regarding-our-mission-statement"><strong>Updates regarding our Mission statement</strong></h3>
<p>We refined the language around our mission statement, namely regarding our vision to create an alternative to the United Nations.</p>
<p>The purpose of UN-aligned is threefold:</p>
<ol>
<li>To create a virtual and a different model for a united nations that would put humanity before nationality and planet before greed.</li>
<li>To promote human rights, animal welfare and environmental protection as well as the creation of political parties that would reflect the principles of UN-aligned.</li>
<li>To create a platform for discussion and dissemination of knowledge.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="updates-to-the-creation-of-un-aligned-parishes"><strong>Updates to the creation of UN-aligned Parishes</strong></h3>
<p>UN-aligned Parishes are simply membership hubs created by a self-appointed person committed to the principles of UN-aligned. As of now, Parishes may register with the central office as soon as they have 20 or more adherents with full membership.</p>
<h3 id="updates-regarding-the-international-political-party"><strong>Updates regarding The International Political Party</strong></h3>
<p>The principles of the party will be roughly the same as the articles (1-23) with the added goal of a federal partnership consisting of all states. Details and other agendas will be added according to regional needs in the spirit of the said articles. Once a national branch has enough members and resources to warrant the formation of a political party, its endeavours will be supported by the whole organisation. <a href="https://un-aligned.org/the-international-political-party/">Learn more about the UN-aligned as an International Political Party</a></p>
<h3 id="the-addition-of-a-new-article-into-the-un-aligned-manifesto"><strong>The addition of a new article into the UN-aligned manifesto</strong></h3>
<p>We added a new article to our manifesto, let us introduce you to <a href="https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/economy-trade/">article 23</a>.</p>
<p><strong>‚ÄúArticle 23: Companies and multinational corporations must be regulated fairly.‚Äù</strong></p>
<p><strong>Reasoning</strong><br>
Corporations often get away with murder. Many laws allow them the pillage and exploit, without even giving anything back to the communities they devastate. Often, they pollute to murderous extents and are happy to factor in the fines that would ensue. The pharmaceutical and fuel industries, for example, are notorious for shattering lives and environments, while corrupt governments are happy to let them, as they ignore the plight of masses of their own people. Rigorous legislation must be in place, both at national and international level, to protect people and the environment.</p>
<p><strong>The political party will commit to:</strong></p>

<p>The United Nations is not just any organisation. It is meant to be the organisation par excellence, it is meant to represent humankind. However, the UN spreads itself so thinly it is no wonder that it struggles to meet many of its commitments.</p>
<p>We would like to introduce you to a new feature in The Gordian Magazine. Every month an exclusive piece will highlight the good, bad and the ugly of the events in the UN.</p>
<p>Although organisations like the UN Watch already monitor the activities of the United Nations, they do so by the yardstick of the UN‚Äôs ‚Äúown charter&rsquo;&rsquo;. Holding an organisation that lacks any trace of LGBTQ+ rights in its literature, an organisation that does not hold particularly high values for human rights, an organisation shackled by bullying superpowers is not sufficient nor beneficial.</p>
<p>This is where UN in Focus will shine. We will hold the United Nations accountable to UN-aligned‚Äôs standards.</p>
<p>This series will expose the hypocrisies of self-serving members of the UN and will bring peace, human rights, solidarity and the environment once again to the top of the UN agenda. The first feature of this series will be published in June.</p>

<p>Justice is not a relative term, but for much of our history we have manipulated it to such an extent that we have created a parallel sort of justice. More often than not, human justice is just a sinister doppelg√§nger of justice in its purest form. This is because human justice depends on laws, and as we all know, laws are biased. The justice of the Inquisition, a sharia court or the sham courts of dictatorial regimes are based on very different laws and therefore profess their own unique brands of justice. The one main thing that they do have in common, though, is that they are self-serving. Being tried by a self-serving court is not justice, but rather, quite the opposite, namely, injustice or anti-justice. However, laws are not the only factor influencing justice, as the mechanisms that are in place to apply these laws also play a crucial part in the administration of justice.</p>
<h3 id="international-law"><strong>International Law</strong></h3>
<p>In this article I would like to focus on the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Criminal Court (ICC). Both are contingent on international law and the first test of their fairness lies in the validity and integrity of these laws. The main sources of international law are, according to the Statute of the ICJ as:</p>
<ul>
<li>International treaties and conventions;</li>
<li>International custom as derived from the &ldquo;general practice&rdquo; of states; and</li>
<li>General legal principles &ldquo;recognized by civilized nations&rdquo;.</li>
</ul>
<p>These laws are also influenced by political and legal theories as well as expertise and interpretations offered by international law scholars. Many reflect the 1920 Statutes of the Permanent Court of International Justice, as part of the Covenant of the League of Nations. Indeed, it would take several experts to evaluate these effectively, nevertheless, one does not need to be an authority in this respect to identify some of the glaring weaknesses.</p>
<p>Where are the international laws to prevent ecocide or animal exploitation, for instance? Or where is the law that forces the 70 plus nations that discriminate against LGBTQ+ people to stop doing so? The United Nations argues that its Declaration of Human Rights is ‚Äúunequivocal‚Äù when it claims that: ‚ÄúAll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.‚Äù This is nonsense! How else could over a third of its Member States get away with criminalising homosexual acts?</p>
<p>As for the mandates, mechanisms and functions of the ICJ and the ICC, they are very different, as are their successes and failures.</p>
<h3 id="the-international-court-of-justiceicj"><strong>The International Court of Justice</strong>¬†(ICJ)</h3>
<p><a href="https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/unravelling-the-united-nations-argead-style-officially-published/"><img src="/images/Book-cover-mockup-copy-150x150.jpg" alt="Unravelling The United Nations, Argead style"></a></p>
<p>Unravelling the UN</p>
<p><em>(This section on the ICJ is taken from my book <a href="https://un-aligned.org/un-aligned-news/unravelling-the-united-nations-argead-style-officially-published/">Unravelling the United Nations</a>)</em></p>
<p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) is ‚Äúthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations.‚Äù It took over from and ‚Äúis based upon the Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice‚Äù that was established by the League of Nations in 1920. ‚ÄúThe Court‚Äôs role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by authorized United Nations organs and specialized agencies.</p>
<p>The Court is composed of 15 judges, who are elected for terms of office of nine years by the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. It is assisted by a Registry, its administrative organ. Its official languages are English and French.‚Äù</p>
<p>Thus, the ICJ has two main roles, namely: settling disputes that are presented to it by the countries that are involved in conflict (contentious cases) and advising on issues referred to it through UN channels (advisory proceedings). It is therefore very different from the International Criminal Court [ICC], which only deals with individuals&hellip;</p>
<p>The ICJ can only adjudicate when all the States involved in the case in question have accepted the court‚Äôs jurisdiction. This may be done in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>‚ÄúBy entering into a special agreement to submit the dispute to the Court;</li>
<li>By virtue of a jurisdictional clause, i.e., typically, when they are parties to a treaty containing a provision whereby, in the event of a dispute of a given type or disagreement over the interpretation or application of the treaty, one of them may refer the dispute to the Court;</li>
<li>Through the reciprocal effect of declarations made by them under the Statute, whereby each has accepted the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory in the event of a dispute with another State having made a similar declaration. A number of these declarations, which must be deposited with the United Nations Secretary-General, contain reservations excluding certain categories of dispute.‚Äù</li>
</ol>
<p>After a case has been submitted to the judgement of the court, the States involved are expected to abide by its decision. Should a party wish to ignore the rulings of the court, the other party may call on the Security Council to intervene:</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf any party to a case fails to perform the obligations incumbent upon it under a judgment rendered by the Court, the other party may have recourse to the Security Council, which may, if it deems necessary, make recommendations or decide upon measures to be taken to give effect to the judgment.‚Äù</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Permanent members fo the Security Council, can easily dismiss the decisions ICJ</p></blockquote>
<p>The Security Council, however, may also choose to dismiss the decisions of the court through one or more of its permanent members, even if these members had previously submitted to its jurisdiction. This happened spectacularly in 1986, with the case of Nicaragua versus the United States. Nicaragua had filed a case against the USA accusing it of mining its ports and of supporting the Contras in their attack on the legitimate government of Nicaragua. Owing to the USA‚Äôs previous acceptance of the Court with regards to the jurisdiction over such disputes, the suit was considered valid, despite the USA arguing against this. The ICJ had the final word because its Statute specifies that in case of doubt, it is up to the ICJ to decide whether its jurisdiction was lawful or not.</p>
<p>The US withdrew its previous commitments that were applicable to the case, but the ruling went ahead. The USA was ordered to terminate its aggression against Nicaragua and to pay reparations. The US refused to comply and ‚Äúvetoed‚Äù the ruling on 28 October 1986. Two other permanent members of the Security Council ‚Äì the United Kingdom and France ‚Äì abstained, as did Thailand. A few days later, on 3 November, the General Assembly voted by a majority of 94 to 3 on a resolution (A/RES/41/31) calling for the USA to respect the ruling. Only El Salvador and Israel joined the USA in voting against the resolution.</p>
<p>The UN list of ICJ rulings does not even include the Nicaragua versus the United States case. This is because, in 1978, the ICJ decided that only cases that were accepted by responding parties should be included. As such, it only publicises its successes. The same does not apply for advisory proceedings, however, and the Court‚Äôs opinions are listed in these cases, as the recent conclusions on the issue concerning the Chagos Archipelago indicates.</p>
<p>The Chagos Archipelago, the largest island of which is Diego Garcia, remained under British control when Mauritius received its independence in 1965. The British proceeded to change its name to the British Indian Ocean Territory [BIOT], deport all of its residents (about 1,500 people) and set up a US/UK military base.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UK was ‚Äúunder an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago‚Äù</p></blockquote>
<p>On 25 February 2019, the ICJ found that ‚Äúthe process of decolonisation of Mauritius was not lawfully completed when that country acceded to independence‚Äù. It therefore concluded that the United Kingdom was ‚Äúunder an obligation to bring to an end its administration of the Chagos Archipelago as rapidly as possible.‚Äù The UK Government, however, made it immediately clear that it would disregard the advisory verdict. Soon after the decision, Karen Pierce, the UK Permanent Representative to the UN, declared that: ‚Äúthe United Kingdom has no doubt about our sovereignty over British Indian Ocean Territory‚Äù.</p>
<p>These affairs do not only exemplify how self-interest can take precedence over justice; they also highlight how UN institutions can be undermined by the very nations that helped create them. They also expose the weakness of the Court, in as much as it depends on the goodwill and the willingness to comply of all the parties involved.</p>
<h3 id="the-international-criminal-court-icc"><strong>The International Criminal Court</strong> (ICC)</h3>
<p>The ICC is very different from the ICJ, although it is easy enough to confuse the two courts. The fact that both are headquartered in The Hague, in the Netherlands, has added to the confusion. The ICC was set up by the Rome Statute in 1998 and only began operations in 2002. Its purpose is specifically to judge individuals accused of committing serious crimes, namely: genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, crimes of aggression and offences against the administration of justice. While all UN member States ‚Äúare <em>ipso facto</em> parties to the Statute‚Äù of the ICJ, the ICC is not an organ of the UN, nor is it universally recognised. Nevertheless, the UN Security Council is one of the authorities that can trigger a trial; the others being a State party and the actual Prosecutor.</p>
<p>When it comes to defining specific crimes, the ICC is unambiguous, which is not surprising considering the extent of violence involved. In all, however, the ICC has only managed to indict 45 people, although most are tried in absentia and never brought to justice. Many cases are also dropped due to a lack of sufficient evidence. Successful convictions include the first in 2006, that of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo for war crimes committed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the last, Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi (in 2016), a Tuareg Islamist responsible of war crimes in Mali.</p>
<p>One of the main problems is that State cooperation is necessary for the ICC to mount successful cases. Without this, the court would face several problems, including reaching the convict and the necessary witnesses. Cases are therefore often cherry-picked, with many centring around Africa. Another problem is that when people in power are convicted in absentia, they then become desperate to cling on to power at all costs in order to avoid being extradited to face justice, as was the case with Omar al-Bashir of Sudan. Most concerning is the fact that investigations can take decades to conclude. This is obscene. No wonder so many of those indicted die before their case is concluded.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 2012, Jon Silverman, writing for the BBC, highlighted the main issue:</p></blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe International Criminal Court (ICC) currently has an annual budget of over $140m (¬£90m) and 766 staff. Since its inception, its estimated expenditure has been around $900m (¬£600m). With only one completed trial to show for a decade of effort and expenditure, the ICC has faced regular criticism that it sucks in investment with few results to show for it.‚Äù</p>
<p>The situation is no better today. The ICC‚Äôs budget for 2021 is ‚Ç¨148,259,000, and with about 14 ongoing investigations, that is over ‚Ç¨10.5 million a case. Moreover, six of those cases date back to over a decade since the investigation opened. The overall cost per case is therefore a good deal higher. One may argue that the existence of the court itself serves as a deterrent and that its value should therefore not be judged by the number of investigations alone. However, with so few success stories to speak about, it is highly unlikely that the ICC constitutes much of a deterrent.</p>
<h3 id="international-justice-are-we-better-off-without-the-icj-and-the-icc"><strong>International Justice</strong>: Are we better off without the ICJ and the ICC?</h3>
<p>On the one hand, until we have a better system to replace them, the answer is ‚Äòno‚Äô; but on the other, if they lead us to sit back complacently thinking that they are the solution to international justice, the answer is ‚Äòyes‚Äô. Something better is clearly needed: a justice system that is founded on clear ethical principles that do not need decades to unravel and effective mechanisms that cannot be undermined by Nation States.</p>
<p>In the next issue of <em>The Gordian</em>, I will offer some suggestions on what this revised view of international justice could look like.</p>

<p>In the Palaeozoic era, an order of molluscs with red shells, called ammonites, had spread through all the sea since they had the ability not just to live underwater, but also to expel water from their shell and thus rise and descend. Their success with respect to other forms of life led them to reproduce until they saturated their environment and became extinct. The reason is the uncontainable growth of the species.</p>
<p>The large stone statues that we see today on Easter Island are the visible trace of the passage of a population that died out following the total deforestation of the land. The source of life on the island was in fact the very trees that were used for the transport and erection of those totems, symbols of political and religious power.</p>
<p>The reason for the extinction is arguably due to the iniquitous exploitation of nature for the construction of symbols of artifice. In today‚Äôs world, these two factors are combined: the unbounded reproduction of human beings and the consumption of our natural resources for the progressive growth of the artificial product. Thus, the prospect is that of a growing risk of the extinction of our species.</p>
<p>In the past, the family was made up of members of all the different generations and the children, who were raised in part by their grandparents. The network was fundamental as a workforce focused on an agricultural and artisanal economy. The Industrial Revolution, from the 19th century onwards, has broken down the extended family system by offering each member economic independence. The resulting prosperity has created a situation of alienation in family and generational ties. We are now faced with the need to build new relationships between people of different ages, while preserving the autonomy of individuals.</p>
<p>The experience of co-housing, which originated in Scandinavia, could be a significant example of such interaction. This is based on structures in which a number of people or families live in a residential community with common facilities. The independence of the private home remains guaranteed by personal rooms, but these are supplemented by shared spaces and resources like a library, living room, kitchen, household appliances, workshops gyms, guestrooms, vegetable gardens, cars, nursery facilities, gardens and the individual skills of the inhabitants.</p>
<p>These communities are not based on ideological or religious principles, but on the desire to recreate a lost sociability and to live in a way that has a sustainable environmental footprint and in which running costs can be shared, reducing the expense of daily life. In these places, the old and the young are able to share their time, knowledge and ideas. In such places, creativity can flourish and art, in its widest sense, can be a means of setting in motion common and unifying experiences.</p>
<p>Michelangelo Pistoletto, attaches, among all the areas highlighted above, the highest importance to education. With his words:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>‚ÄúEvery society brings up children according to its own ways and customs, but at this moment it is precisely ‚Äòways and customs‚Äô that have to change, and to do so profoundly. Devoting ourselves to education of children means effecting, through their forming , our own transformation as well. The attitude of the individual towards him or herself and towards the community is shaped in the first 15 years of life.‚Äù¬†
</code></pre><p>The Information and Communication Age, now fully in force, will make a great difference in this area. Although of relatively recent origins, the history of information technology has gone through a change equivalent to the one that led from the time of mammoths to today‚Äôs human beings. The scientific view of education is certainly not limited to the utilisation of technology. Let‚Äôs take music, for example: it can be transposed mathematically and in this mathematics, even the freest and most complex expression of the emotions and imagination is organised and expressed. The imagination leads into the universe of possibilities. Childhood fantasy is a continual investigation of the possible.</p>

<p><em>By Carla Pietrobattista</em></p>
<p><img src="/images/700-years-of-dante-1024x614.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Joseph Anton Koch ‚Äì Inferno (1825-28)</p>
<p>The following article is taken from a speech given by Carla Pietrobattista on Dante Day, March 25, which is traditionally held as the day the ‚Äúdivine poet‚Äù started his masterpiece, the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. 2021 also marks the 700th anniversary of Dante‚Äôs death. The event was presided by the Mayor of Magliano dei Marsi, Pasqualino di Cristofano. Ms. Pietrobattista will also be collaborating on the new Art Section of <em>The Gordian</em>, which will start next month.</p>
<h3 id="picking-up-the-gauntlet"><strong>Picking up the gauntlet</strong></h3>
<p>What happens in real life when some encounters change you and remain in your heart, also happens in art; sometimes you get the feeling that some works have been made specifically for us, to make our souls vibrate. It is for this reason that when I was asked to talk about Dante I immediately said yes, because there was a moment in my life when I felt that he had touched my heart and has never left it since. I consider this immediate and spontaneous acceptance, more of an emotional than a rational response, for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, I had only three days to transform a set of personal thoughts and feelings into something concrete. Secondly,¬† I have always had the conviction that talking about Dante would be difficult, even risky, because many scholars and experts over the centuries have done so with greater knowledge and skills than mine. Finally, having studied Dante both in high school and at university could have led me to simply relay well-known and commonplace concepts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realized that I not only could, but I absolutely had to talk about Dante</p></blockquote>
<p>My love for Dante blossomed at the University of Perugia, where I was lucky enough to follow the lectures of one of the greatest authorities on Dante. Thanks to his insight, I became curious to know more about Dante the person. This changed my perspective, so when I received the invitation, I realized that I not only could, but I absolutely had to talk about Dante.</p>
<h3 id="dantes-universality"><strong>Dante‚Äôs universality</strong></h3>
<p>Having made these necessary clarifications, I would like to start talking about the great poet with a question that in my opinion is at the basis of every discourse that concerns him, namely: why is it necessary to know Dante? Especially now that we are experiencing the most dramatic historical moment since the Second World War, why should we waste time talking about a man who died 700 years ago?</p>
<p>In my opinion, Dante gives us the answer directly in the first lines of his most important work, the &lsquo;Commedia&rsquo;, when he affirms, without the slightest need to hide his weakness and fragility, that he was lost:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;In the midway of this our mortal life,I found me in a gloomy wood, astrayGone from the path direct: and e‚Äôen to tellIt were no easy task, how savage wildThat forest, how robust and rough its growth,Which to remember only, my dismayRenews, in bitterness not far from death.Yet to discourse of what there good befel,All else will I relate discover‚Äôd there.‚Äù(Inferno canto I, verses. 1 to 9 - Tr. Rev. H. F. Cary ).
</code></pre><p>This is why it is now more necessary than ever to get closer to Dante. One must not remember him in a sterile and obsequious way, or because this year marks the 700th anniversary of his death, but because Dante was able to speak to everyone, not only to his contemporaries, of how one can and must cross the darkest of woods to return to see the stars.</p>
<p>In order to understand what role Dante can play in our life, it is necessary to know him in a less historical and clinical way than we are used to and delineate his personality as much as his historicity.</p>
<p>It is precisely in this direction that I would like to try to move in order to transmit and share as much as possible the emotions I felt when I understood Dante&rsquo;s greatness as a man, a step that turned out to be fundamental for my understanding of Dante&rsquo;s work as a poet.</p>
<h3 id="the-man-and-his-name"><strong>The man and his name</strong></h3>
<p>Durante, son of Alighiero, or Alaghiero di Bellincione and his first wife Bella Degli Amati, was born in Florence in May 1265 from a family with ties to ancient Guelph nobility. The name Durante however, does not identify him, but his diminutive Dante, does. I have always liked to toy with the name, starting from the Latin affirmation &ldquo;Nomen Omen&rdquo;; the ancient Romans believed that a person‚Äôs destiny was written in their name. In the case of Dante, I believe that this is the case, his name which originates from a verbal form, is the present participle of the verb to give, that is, he who gives and Dante has given, has given each of us the greatest masterpiece of literature of all times, the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. The now universal knowledge of Dante‚Äôs name means that it is not necessary to specify his surname, as Dante is recognised everywhere. I am one of the many Carlas; Dante however, is unique. Dante is identified and associated not only with his works, but also with his person of which we were able to get an idea thanks to the description transmitted to us by Boccaccio, one of the first scholars of the <em>Divine Comedy</em> and the first to define it as such.</p>
<h3 id="a-son-of-florence"><strong>A son of Florence</strong></h3>
<p>Surely another element that over time has become Dante&rsquo;s identifier is the city of Florence with which a sort of duality has formed: Dante \ Florence - Florence \ Dante. Identifying Dante with his city is one of the greatest clich√©s I could propose, but among the many it is the one that more than others has a solid foundation. Dante would not have been Dante without the unique political and cultural vivacity that Florence, the future cradle of the Renaissance, could offer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All my ills and inconveniences found their cause in the unfortunate events of my priory</p></blockquote>
<p>Florence, the pain and delight of the supreme poet, is where Dante began his political career in 1295 as prior from June 15 to August 15 of 1300. It is precisely in this period that the unfortunate events of the poet originated, as he himself affirms:¬† &ldquo;All my ills and inconveniences found their cause in the unfortunate events of my priory&rdquo;. In fact, it was during his priory period that the well-known Florentine conflict between the Cerchi family and that of the Donati took place. This resulted in the split between the Guelphs into the White Guelphs and the Black Guelphs. Dante, a well-known white Guelph, suffered at the hands of the black Guelphs who could count on the support of the Pope and Charles of Valois. In this context, he was found guilty of ‚Äúbaratteria‚Äù, that is, of illicit gains.The poet was sentenced in absentia to the payment of a fine, to two years of confinement and to the interdiction of public office.</p>
<p>Dante, who had been able to interpret the evolution of events and the danger he ran, was not in Florence at the time of his sentence and never returned there. Precisely for this reason he never paid the fine and the sentence was transformed into confiscation of assets and death at the stake if he returned to his city. Thus was born the figure of the exiled Florentine Dante, far from his city and his loved ones, forced to experience how hard it was to climb the stairs of others, he who is described by Boccaccio as ‚Äúmelancholy and pensive and with a very high and disdainful soul.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="the-divine-comedy"><strong>The Divine Comedy</strong></h3>
<p>The distance from home and the humiliation of being at the service of other gentlemen created the fertile ground for the birth of a text called the <em>Divine Comedy</em>. ‚ÄòComedy‚Äô, because it was characterised by a tragic beginning but a happy ending; ‚ÄòDivine‚Äô for its composition characteristics. It is within this work that Dante proved to be not only a poet, but also an attentive and refined man of culture whose knowledge ranged from ancient literature to justice and from astronomy to mathematics. His genius was capable of enclosing an immense literary work in the mysticism of the Middle Ages, choosing the number three symbol of the trinity, and the number ten symbol of perfection. It is on these numbers that the construction of the entire opus is contained, which is written in triplets. The three canticles are divided into thirty-three cantos. To the total of ninety-nine, a sort of preface was added to reach the sublime perfection of one hundred, or ten times ten. Within his world so perfectly structured, the poet faced the most magnificent of travels, the journey par excellence for the man of the Middle Ages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inside Hell, Dante met souls whose actual bodies were still alive on earth</p></blockquote>
<p>Dante, the ideal man of the Middle Ages, solid, consistent, but above all a man of faith was, within his work, the first and only common being to &ldquo;walk&rdquo; the roads of the three kingdoms of the afterlife. In so doing he was a witness of despair, hope and perfect joy. It is only thanks to what he says he saw that, at times, I can find the only possible explanation in the face of the manifestation of evil in its most absolute form. Dante in fact, inside the first kingdom, Hell, met souls whose actual bodies were still alive on earth, but inhabited by demons.</p>
<h3 id="master-of-time-and-space"><strong>Master of time and space</strong></h3>
<p>Dante was not only supreme among poets, but he was also a man of exquisite ingenuity. He describes, with incredible modernity, his concept of Italy and Europe, openly or even simply, by naming historical events such as the battle of Tagliacozzo, the outcome of which determined the new balances that shaped Europe as we know it.</p>
<p>Besides being an expert in politics and culture, Dante understood man and all his feelings, sensitive to the point of making love eternal even when damned, as in the case of Paolo and Francesca. The complexity of the Divine Comedy, for me, is such as to lead me to define Dante as the master of time and space. Of time, because within Hell, Purgatory and Paradise, the environments in which his work takes place, he makes the condemnation or salvation of his characters eternal and yet contemporary.¬† Of space, because he manages to give shape and dimension to the realms of the underworld which, together with souls, do not occupy space and have no form.</p>
<h3 id="the-freedom-to-choose"><strong>The freedom to choose</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>By not paying the fine Dante had chosen to remain true to himself, a coherent and integral intellectual, not a mercenary.</p></blockquote>
<p>It may seem completely inappropriate on my part to pick the concept of freedom for my title, since Dante was not even free to return home without running the risk of being killed. Dante&rsquo;s greatness and freedom, however, was precisely that of choosing between good and evil. By not paying the fine Dante had chosen to remain true to himself, a coherent and integral intellectual, not a mercenary. The same freedom to choose between good and evil has been enjoyed by all the characters of the <em>Divine Comedy</em> who, depending on their actions, are found in the various realms of the afterlife.</p>
<p>Dante had the courage that only free men can have when he found himself judging the souls of his work, making sure, however, never to present himself as God, putting those who according to him deserved Hell, starting from his enemies, without ever appearing as the deus ex machina within the scene, but as a spectator of the divine will: at times merciless, at times moved.</p>
<p>I believe he reached the highest freedom when, sure of his maturity and intellectual perfection, he felt ready and worthy to talk again about Beatrice, his only true love. As I have already said, Dante was a man of the Middle Ages, and as such he had not been free to live out his love for Beatrice. He had already been promised to Gemma Donati, while Beatrice had been betrothed to Simone dei Bardi.</p>
<p>In his world of perfect balance, woven by the wise hand of the One who can do what he wants, Beatrice can finally be close to Dante. She is in fact one of the three guides along the journey in the three kingdoms. We remember Virgil, symbol of reason in the kingdom of the underworld, where there could be no hope; Beatrice in purgatory, symbol of active love and prayer and therefore of hope; Saint Bernard, symbol of the contemplative love of those who see God in Paradise.</p>
<h3 id="freedom-through-knowledge"><strong>Freedom through knowledge</strong></h3>
<p>So let&rsquo;s go back to the initial question, why is it necessary to know Dante? In my opinion we must know him to be free, because we can only be truly free through knowledge, we are all called to culture just as Dante tells us through Ulysses, in some way the poet&rsquo;s own image: &ldquo;/images/You were not made to live like brutes, but to follow virtue and knowledge &ldquo;(Inferno cantoXXVI, verse 119).</p>
<p>Only thanks to knowledge can those ideals be born in us without which we will be condemned to run forever in a wild goose chase.</p>

<p>1916: Performers at Oxford College May Day celebration</p>
<p>May Day, Labour Day or International Workers¬¥ Day has been celebrated in various ways throughout history. The Modern May Day is not only celebrated around the world by parades and parties, but also demonstrations and rallies in support of workers and human rights.</p>
<p>On May 1st, 1890, demonstrators called by the Second International gathered together to honour the martyrs of the Haymarket Affair in 1886. Since then, it has been more associated with the labour movement of the 20th century than with its roots as an ancient spring festival. This gallery guides you through some of the various different events that take place on May Day.</p>
