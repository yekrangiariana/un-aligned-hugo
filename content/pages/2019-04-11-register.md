UN-aligned is a community that is working towards a better United Nations.

If you believe that the current United Nations is failing in its primary duty of safeguarding world peace and human rights, and that reform is not enough to address its inherent problems, then UN-aligned is the right fit for you.

As a member, you can be part of a movement towards a more effective and representative international organisation that puts the needs of individuals and communities before those of nations.

Join UN-aligned now and make a difference in the way we do politics for the betterment of humanity.
