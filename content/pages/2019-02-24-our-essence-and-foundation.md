## UN-aligned's Mission Statement

Read our [mission statement in the official manifesto](http://un-aligned.org/manifesto/#mission-statement​). 

### Virtual & Alternative UN

Our aim is to offer a transformative model for global governance that puts humanity and the planet first. We are actualising this vision through 'The Alternative UN,' a virtual initiative designed to function as a prototype for a more equitable international system. [The Alternative UN](https://un-aligned.org/the-alternative-un/)

### Advocacy and Political Mobilisation

We strive to be champions for human rights, animal welfare, environmental protection and world peace. In line with this, we have established the 'International Political Party,' which aligns with the principles laid out in our Manifesto. We also undertake campaigns and educational initiatives to further these causes. [Read the Manifesto](https://un-aligned.org/manifesto/#articles)

### Platform for Dialogue

Our goal is to create an open space for meaningful discussion and knowledge-sharing. 'The Gordian Magazine' is our primary vehicle for this, supplemented by interactive forums, webinars, and social media channels that encourage active participation from our members.
