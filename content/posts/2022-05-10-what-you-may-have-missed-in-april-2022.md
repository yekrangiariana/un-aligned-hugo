Last month's news from the Americas


## **THE AMERICAS**

03.04.22: **Ecuador**. A prison riot has left at least 12 people dead and several others injured. The unrest in El Turi prison in Cuenca started when inmates revolted against a gang that was trying to assert its dominance. Prison riots are common in Ecuador with 320 inmates killed in 2021 alone.

04.04.22: **Costa Rica**. Right wing Rodrigo Chaves Robles, a former finance minister and World Bank official, has won the presidential election and will take over from President Carlos Alvarado Quesada on May 8, 2022.

11.04.22: **Mexico**. President López Obrador has won the referendum he initiated on whether he should complete his six-year term or step down.

Last month's news from Europe


## **EUROPE**

03.04.22: **Hungary.** Victor Orban has won a fourth consecutive term as Prime Minister, beating all his rivals who had pooled together in order to oust him. The authoritarian leader used his victory speech to have a dig at Brussels, with whom he is frequently clashing on human rights issues.

04.04.22: **Serbia**. Populist President Aleksandar Vučić has secured a second term in office by comfortably winning the presidential election. Though he has mellowed with time, his legacy is a divisive one. In July 1995, commenting on NATO’s bombing campaign against the army of the Republika Srpska who had just committed the Srebrenica Massacre, Vučić had said that "for every Serb killed, we will kill 100 Muslims!"

12.04.22: **UK**. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak have been fined by police for breaking the law relating to COVID-19 restrictions. Johnson had repeatedly reassured parliament and the nation that he and his colleagues had not broken any rules, which was clearly not the case. The Ministerial Code calls for the resignation of members who lie to parliament. Opposition leaders are also demanding the resignation of both men for having dishonoured their office. Over 50 fines have been issued so far in relation to a series of Downing Street parties during lockdown, including one for Mrs. Carrie Johnson, the Prime Minister’s wife. More fines are expected as the investigation continues.

14.04.22: **UK**. The British government came under severe criticism following its unveiling of its plans to transfer some asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing as a means of discouraging them from entering the UK illegally.

24.04.22: **France**. Incumbent President Emmanuel Macron has won the presidential election with 58.55 percent in the runoff vote. His far-right challenger Marine Le Pen gained 41.45 percent.

25.04.22: **Slovenia**. Political newcomer Robert Golob of the relatively new left wing Freedom Movement has won the most votes in the parliamentary elections. He is likely to lead a coalition government with smaller left wing parties, thus ending  Janez Janša’s radical right wing rule.

26.04.22: **Moldova**. President Maia Sandu convened a special security meeting following a number of blasts at strategic sites in the breakaway pro-Russian region of Transnistria. The explosions are thought to be part of a ploy by Moscow to generate a pretext for occupation.

## **ASIA**

02.04.22**: Sri Lanka**. In the wake of mass protests triggered by rising prices and food shortages, the government has imposed a 36-hour curfew from Saturday evening to Monday morning; this is on the back of a state of emergency which was declared yesterday. Social media has also been blocked.

03.04.22: **Sri Lanka**. In the midst of ongoing riots, all 26 cabinet ministers resigned from government except for the President Rajapaksa’s brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is staying on as Prime Minister. The move was billed as a preparation for the formation of a new government, but protestors have made it clear that they will only be satisfied until the president himself is removed.

07.04.22: **Turkey**. The trial in absentia of 26 Saudis accused of killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi on October 2, 2018 has been halted. The case has now been transferred to Saudi Arabia. Seeing as the order to assassinate Khashoggi appears to have been given by the highest authorities in Saudi Arabia, the prospect of a fair trial has become very unlikely.

10.04.22: **Pakistan**. Prime Minister Imran Khan has been ousted from his post by a no-confidence vote. The ex-cricket champion had tried to avoid the vote by dissolving parliament and calling for new elections, but his plan failed after the High Court ruled that his move was unconstitutional. Khan was claiming interference of foreign powers in the wake of his friendly meeting with Russia’s president Putin just as the invasion of Ukraine had begun.

11.04.22: **Pakistan**. Shahbaz Sharif has been chosen as the new Prime Minister. He is the brother of Nawaz Sharif, who had served as Prime Minister three times before being removed from office in 2017 owing to revelations relating to the Panama Papers.

13.04.22: **The Philippines**. Scores of people have died and many are unaccounted for after torrential rains caused floods and mudslides in Leyte Province.

21.04.22: **Afghanistan**. Several people have been killed or wounded in an explosion in a Shi’ite mosque in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif.

23.04.22: **Turkey**. Activist Osman Kavala was given a life sentence without parole, while seven other defendants received 18 years in prison for their role in the 2013 protests, which the prosecution claimed were aimed at toppling the government.

25.04.22: **China**. Beijing is the latest city to shut down residential and business districts amid a new outbreak of COVID-19 which is rapidly spreading through China’s major cities.

25.04.22: **India/Pakistan**. A severe heatwave is gripping both nations as temperatures continue to rise causing serious problems and risks for people, animals and crops.

"We are dealing with a state that turns its veto at the UN Security Council into the right to \[cause\] death."

“Where is the security that the Security Council is supposed to guarantee?”

“If this continues, the finale will be that each state will rely only on the power of arms to ensure its security, not on international law, not on international institutions...”

07.04.22: “I think the deal that Ukraine is offering is fair. You give us weapons, we sacrifice our lives, and the war is contained in Ukraine...” Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba appealing to NATO.

14.04.22: They’ve been trying to destroy us for 50 days, but the Ukrainian people are heroically resisting. We fear nothing, we know what we’re fighting for.
