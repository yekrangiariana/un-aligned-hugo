This is war my dear!  
Invasion for pure greed and gratification.  
What else can this be?  
Civilians, soldiers, casualties dying.  
In their blood lying.  
This is war my dear!  
Lives are meaningless,  
The soul is downcast and sighing.  
This is the battlefield, blood, brutality.  
Politicians lacking  rationality.  
Aggression, destruction, death and ravished.  
Soldiers and innocent lying on the streets.  
Surely logic has perished.  
This is war my dear!  
The cold carnage continues …  
Unleashed on humanity.  
Mourning for innocent lives.  
Who will stop the insanity?  
Can people not see such torment and tragedy?  
This is war my dear!  
There is only depravity and brutality…
