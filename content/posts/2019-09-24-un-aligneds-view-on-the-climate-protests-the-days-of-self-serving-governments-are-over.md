## **"We're at war with nature. If we win, we're lost" Hubert Reeves**

As the level of CO2 emissions reach their highest level in 10 million years, children and adults,  from an estimated of 185 countries, unite across continents and time-zones to demonstrate against politicians’ incompetence in dealing with this extraordinary challenge of our time.

These protests come at a time when the Amazon forests are being burnt to ashes, a “biological annihilation” of wildlife is in sight and the consequences of melting ice in Greenland is about to give birth to a whole new group of internationally displaced people: climate refugees.

## **The next generation of “eco-warriors”**

In the past weeks we have witnessed more political leadership on the streets than in most democratic institutions around our globe and this is only the beginning. While the demands that climate protestors have are many, the main message is clear: urgent action to cut emissions and stabilise the climate. Teenager and activist _Greta Thunberg_ has been an inspiration to a new generation of “eco-warriors” who know that the topic of climate emergency directly correlates with their prospects and well-being. 

UN-aligned believes that the exhortations and announcements of blunt policies on climate are barely enough to achieve real solutions. Our governments’ commitments to mitigating the effects of the climate emergency need to be enforced. We encourage individuals to stop playing the blame game and “Protect, Restore and Fund” our earth, its nature and wildlife. Join your local movement and vote for people who defend nature.

## **Do you really need a ten-year-old to show you how?**

A 10-year-old climate activist, called _Parker,_ recited a poem with a powerful message on climate change at the global climate strike in Brisbane, Australia.
