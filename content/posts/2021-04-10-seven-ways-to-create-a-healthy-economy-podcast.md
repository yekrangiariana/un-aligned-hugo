Kate Raworth first introduced her visual representation of what a healthy economy could look like in a 2012 OXFAM discussion paper titled: "A safe and just space for humanity: can we live within the doughnut?" The doughnut represented the safe space where humanity could thrive sandwiched between its inner and outer limits, namely our social and planetary boundaries.

Raworth’s 2017 book develops the idea further. The seven “ways” she explores are simple, well researched, grounded and achievable. Click [here](https://un-aligned.org/climate-emergency/the-doughnut-economy/) to read this piece.
