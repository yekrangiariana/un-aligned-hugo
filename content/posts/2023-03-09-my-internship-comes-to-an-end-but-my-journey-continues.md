During my internship at the UN-aligned, I did my best to convey the suffering of refugees and their lives in the camps through interviews and life in the camp. As a refugee myself, I now want to share one last story.

Recently, I met a 23-year-old returning from work in the stone sawmills with his clothes covered in dust. He was the son of our neighbour and one of the brightest students at his university. He was forced to leave school due to forced majeure and ended up supporting his family by working in the mills.

In our estrangement, we have learned the power of education. An educated person can uplift their companions to the top. We ask for more support regarding education, so all children can obtain their right to learn. Especially in these difficult economic conditions, we need people who can teach the young. We cannot afford private lessons for our children.

We call on those who can support us to establish new educational institutions in the camps so that our children can learn. This way, they can graduate and obtain good job opportunities. People should have the chance to get a decent job, and through work, we can encourage the younger generations.

Despite the difficult circumstances we face, we still hold on to hope for a beautiful and peaceful life, a prosperous future for our children and a society built on science and knowledge.

After graduation, I plan to support educational institutions to provide job opportunities for young graduates and to help educate children who have no one to stand up for them and teach them. 

Your support for the education of refugees in camps would bring us one step closer to achieving our dreams and lifting ourselves out of these difficult circumstances.
