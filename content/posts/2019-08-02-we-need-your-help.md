UN-aligned is slowly, but surely, taking its place in the world arena of politics. We are also increasingly being criticised by different sides of the political spectrum. We love constructive criticism as this helps us develop and refine our mission. However, most objections simply imply that UN-aligned is “too idealistic.” This should fuel us all the more and encourage us to create stronger unity amongst ourselves. Together, there is nothing to stop us from creating the basis for a true United Nations.

We are aware that our ambitions and dreams are not easy to achieve and that our mission is likely to take time. However, it is essential that the momentum is maintained. We feel that in the past months UN-aligned’s name has been buried under the vast amount of data on the internet; barely noticed and unlikely to be turbocharged by any search engine’s algorithms. We think more people need to hear about UN-aligned; **this is why we are asking for your support today.**

### **But what can I do?**

Supporting UN-aligned goes beyond donating a few pennies a month. **We want you, our members, to take complete charge of UN-aligned**.

Last months, UN-aligned received the generous support of like-minded individuals in various fields including: graphic design, photography, journalism and participation in recent UN-aligned projects, such as the new upcoming book about the shortcomings of the United Nations. **No matter what you can do, we want you**. Write to us with your talents and we’ll make it work. 

### **Print out a placard and support us**

You can also **spread a word about us on your social media**.

Simply download one of UN-aligned’s posters and post it on your social media using the hashtag: #StandWithUNalignd

We are eagerly anticipating your collaboration with UN-aligned. You will be creating a better and more tolerable world for yourself, your friends and everyone around you.
