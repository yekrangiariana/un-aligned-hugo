Question:

Hi. Why are train workers on strike? They earn more than teachers and nurses anyway.

✏️ **_Ruby’s answer_**:  
Dear reader,  
  
Congratulations and many thanks for pointing out that train workers are not the only overworked and underpaid sector in the UK.   
  
The RMT union coordinated a strike - which includes not just those “greedy, overpaid” drivers who I’m sure are buzzing about inconveniencing the public, but a whole host of workers key to the British rail infrastructure, from the train cleaner to the railway lubricator.  
  
Consider this for a moment: if their strike causes this much inconvenience to the average British traveller, then perhaps it’s time to meet these critical workers at their reasonable request of an 11% pay increase, in line with inflation?  
  
Finally, a lockdown showed us what the critical jobs are. Yes, nurses and teachers fall into that category too. A pay rise for train workers does not rob teachers and nurses of a pay rise, their salaries are not paid from the same pot. We support industrial action for them too.
