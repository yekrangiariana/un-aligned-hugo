The Gordian rolls on with its messages of peace and light and respect, but notwithstanding, the world seems to be getting darker and more troubled. 

Climate disasters are no longer the exception, while the threat of a nuclear apocalypse is more real than it ever has been. Giving in is not an option. On the contrary we must double our efforts to combat all that is a threat to the dignity and wellbeing of humanity and the survival of earth’s multifaceted manifestations of nature. Being marginally involved with organisations like UN-aligned is no longer enough. Each and every one of us needs to do more, both as individuals and as part of our communities, be they local, or global like UN-aligned. For want of a nail the shoe was lost… then the horse, the rider, the message, the battle and finally, the kingdom. We are that nail, but we have been led to believe that our input is insignificant. It isn’t. So The Gordian will continue to roll on with your support and inspiration: a platform for the sharing of ideas and information and a launchpad for exiting ventures.

In this issue we are focussing on war. I was going to add “and the futility of it”, but ‘futility’ is far from the right word. ‘Futile’ means ‘useless’, and sadly that is how many of us who think we are unaffected by it, have considered it: something we could brush off and ignore. No, war is not futile. It too is a nail, and allowed to be, it may well be the last nail in our collective coffin. My lead article will therefore cover the absurdity of war. Related articles include Omar’s articles on the need for a world atomic weapons disarmament agency and demilitarising the atom, and Ayesha’s poem on the violence in Ukraine. Of course, there will be the usual range of additional articles, such as Ariana’s piece on Iran, the Chatterjees’ environmental contribution, Victoria’s interview with California Animal Welfare Association CEO, Jill Tucker and our arts and entertainment columns.

We hope you enjoy these stories and the many more in the following pages. Enjoy! 

Adrian Liberto and Ariana Yekrangi are the Editors of The Gordian Magazine.
