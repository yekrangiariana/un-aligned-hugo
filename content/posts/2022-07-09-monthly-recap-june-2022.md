08.06.22: **DR Congo**: Despite Belgium's King Philippe returning a traditional mask on his visit to the former colony, Belgium has still fallen short of apologising for the atrocities carried out in Congo when under direct rule of the Belgian monarchy. The brutality had cost millions of lives and King Philippe’s visit has rekindled much of the resentment.

18.06.22: **Ethiopia**. Evidence is emerging of a massacre of 200 to 300 civilians in the western region of Oromia. Witnesses blame members of the Oromo Liberation Army (OLA) for carrying out the attack which targeted the ethnic Amharas, who are a minority in the region. The OLA is trying to blame government forces for the massacre.

07.06.22: **USA**. During a Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles, Secretary of State Anthony Blinken dodged questions on why there have been "absolutely no repercussions" for Israel over Abu Akleh's killing, or for Saudi Arabia for the killing of Middle East Eye and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.  He claimed the facts still had to be established, despite irrefutable evidence linking both counties to the respective murders.

18.06.22: **Mexico**. Thirteen people died and several were injured when a transit vehicle crashed into a tree on the Mexico City-Querétaro motorway. The accident comes hours after nine pilgrims were killed in a bus accident in the northeastern Chiapas region.

22.06.22: **El Salvador**. Despite the grim milestone of 40,000 arrests since a state of emergency was imposed in March, Nayib Bukele’s government has once again voted to extend it in order to deal with the surge of gang killings and violence.

24.06.22: **Granada**. The leader of the opposition National Democratic Congress, Dickon Mitchell, was sworn in as Grenada’s ninth Prime Minister after a comfortable win in the general election.

24.06.22: **USA**. The Supreme Court stripped away women’s constitutional protections for abortion after nearly a half-century by nullifying the Roe v. Wade ruling. As a result, many US States are set to criminalise abortion even in cases of rape and incest.

20.06.22: **UK**. Despite the fact that Wikileaks founder Julian Assange could spend the rest of his life in prison if extradited to the United States, Home Secretary Priti Patel has given the green light to his deportation.

The last was held on 18 September 2014 and failed with 55.3% voting against.

The G7 summit of 2022

**06.06.22:** RyanAir is imposing an Afrikaans language test for South Africans wishing to fly with the airline to the UK as an odd and racist means to weed out people with fake passports. Whilst Afrikaans is one of the nation’s 11 official languages, it is a language that was imposed during white-minority rule, which many people do not speak at all. It is only spoken as a first language by less than 13% of the population. The British government is partly to blame for the move as it shifted much of its responsibility for passport control on airlines, with heavy fines should they fail to pick up invalid travel documents.

**16.06.22:** In the wake of heavy criticism for its blatantly racist language test, RyanAir has dropped the requirement.

**27.06.22:** Sanctions against Russia are starting to have a visible impact as Moscow defaulted on its international bonds for the first time in more than a century.
