It is with great pleasure to announce the winners of this year's poetry competition arranged by UN-aligned. This year, we have received 17 poems that creatively portrayed the values that UN-aligned’s [Manifesto](https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/) campaigns for. 

- **The first place** goes to Dean Gessie from Canada for his poem “[Terra Australis Incognita](https://un-aligned.org/culture/terra-australis-incognita/)”.
- And the **second place** goes to Ayesha Kajee from South Africa for her poem “[Silence](https://un-aligned.org/culture/silence/)”.

The selection in the call for works was made by UN-aligned’s literary editor and winner of the international ‘Il Leone D’Oro’ award, [Alex Liberto](https://un-aligned.org/author/alex-liberto/).

Considering there were numerous fantastic works by other UN-aligned members across the world, we have decided to award other participants with extra attention and publish a selection of their works within a new series in the Gordian magazine titled “Poems for a United World”. 

We are also planning to conduct interviews with these writers about their creative journey and ideas for a better and brighter future, so please stay tuned for those. 

Congratulations to our winners and many thanks to all entrants for participating. We hope you consider UN-aligned a home for your poems and ideas for a better world.
