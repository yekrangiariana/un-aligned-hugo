Dear reader,

I’m delighted to have the opportunity to draw attention to the many references to other wars which we have in our archives. 

We have an excellent article on the [inefficiency of sanctions](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-sanctions-dilemma/) referring to the war in South Africa. 

We have written about the [Syrian war](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/how-the-recent-conflicts-in-syria-could-shape-its-future/) from various angles, including [diary entries](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/interview-with-a-syrian-refugee-in-arsal-camp-lebanon/) from Syrian refugees who have joined UN-aligned. 

Take a look at this [gallery](https://un-aligned.org/gallery/surviving-the-victory-life-in-the-war-torn-gaza-strip-in-pictures/) of life in the war torn Gaza strip. 

I’m just getting started here, but make no mistake that we’ve continually referenced global conflicts prior to the 24th of February 2022. 

Indeed it may feel like the conflict in Ukraine is dominating many column inches now, but fear not. I’m confident that unless UN-aligned’s [mission statement](https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/mission-statement-2/), in particular putting humanity before nationality is adopted worldwide, there will be many more new wars dominating The Gordian in the coming issues.
