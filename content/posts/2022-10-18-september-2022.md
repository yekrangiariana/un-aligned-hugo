IAEA Director Rafael Grossi


\_“The IAEA is now there at the plant and it’s not moving. It’s going to stay there. We’re going to have a continued presence there at the plant with some of my experts,”\_IAEA director Rafael Grossi after his team’s visit to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

\_“The assessment is a patchwork of false information that serves as political tools for the U.S. and other Western countries to strategically use Xinjiang to contain China... It again shows that the U.N. Human Rights Office has been reduced to an enforcer and accomplice of the U.S. and other Western countries.”\_Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin commenting on the [Report](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/2022-08-31/22-08-31-final-assesment.pdf) released in the final minutes of High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet’s four-year term (late on August 31) alleging China may be responsible for “international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity”.

Wang Wenbin


\_“All is fair in love and war and espionage... Of course, we spy on other countries. May the best spy win.”\_Rachel Noble, Director General of the Australian Signals Directorate when commenting on recent cyber-attacks targeting prominent Australians. (Reported September 2).

\_“EU Member States have already invested billions of euros to assist vulnerable households. But we know this will not be enough. This is why we are proposing a cap on the revenues of companies that produce electricity at a low cost. These companies are making revenues they never accounted for, they never even dreamt of. In our social market economy, profits are good. But in these times it is wrong to receive extraordinary record profits benefitting from war and on the back of consumers. In these times, profits must be shared and channelled to those who need it the most. Our proposal will raise more than 140 billion euros for Member States to cushion the blow directly.”\_From European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s State of the Union address on 14 September 2022.

\_“We have no confidence in the work of this body. For the past eight months we were waiting for steps to be taken against impunity in Ukraine, and we don’t expect anything more from this institution or a whole range of other international institutions.”\_Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov ironically speaking about “impunity in Ukraine” at a Security Council meeting on September 22 during which accountability for Russia’s crimes was central.

\_“Russian diplomats flee almost as aptly as Russian soldiers.”\_Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba at a Security Council meeting on September 22 after the Russian Foreign Minister stormed out in the middle of the debate.
