The Gordian Magazine is an open, independent publication that is read by hundreds of people around the world. Its main purpose has always been the creation of a platform for discussion and dissemination of knowledge; and with your support, we hope to take our game up a notch and build on this for many years to come.

So far we have managed to do without any financial support, however, as the organisation has grown our need for fundraising has become more and more crucial.

Your support will enable us to spearhead human rights, animal welfare and environmental protection around the globe. It will help us represent you and your ideas of what a united world should look like and facilitate our impact at international events. It will also extend our reach with more powerful networking and journalism.

> The Gordian will remain a free publication

Having asked for your support, it needs to be clarified: The Gordian will always be a free publication. It will remain the magazine that brings the bold voices and ideas of UN-alignders who dream of a united nation that puts humanity before nationality and human decency above the self-interest of super states.Â 

So please support us only if you are in a position to do so. In exchange for your generous support, we offer small perks as a token of our gratitude. You can learn more about them by clicking the link below.

Every contribution, whether big or small, means we can keep investigating and exploring solutions to critical issues of our time. And it only takes a minute.
