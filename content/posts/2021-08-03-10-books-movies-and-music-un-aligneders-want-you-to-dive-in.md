## **Movie: Parasite (2019)**

Gavinski from China says: “I have been meaning to watch this since well before it won the Oscar but never got round to it. Easily the best movie I have seen in years, loved the switch from black comedy to super tense, and its thought-provoking commentary on wealth, poverty and inequality.”

## **TV series: Ragnarok (2020)** 

Matti from Finland says: “Even though the series is fantasy, everything about it feels real and relatable. Whether it is the fight against climate change or standing up to big corporations ruining our planetary resources for pathetic profit. Just like in the series, it will take legends to battle the evil; luckily we have plenty of those heroes in real life.”

## **Book: A fraction of the whole (2008)**

Anahita from Iran says: “In the process of advancing the story, the author has tried to address various topics and chose from the ones that are very important in one’s life; it speaks about life, death, love, family, loneliness, immortality, ugliness, meaning and things like that. The story centres around celebrities and adventurers, which require little attention to follow. There is humor in the writing and the author's mastery of the characters keeps the audience in tune with the narrator.”

## **Book: A Thousand Splendid Suns (2007)**

Dorothea from the UK says: “I've read this book over 6 times I believe, the characters are so alive, it is impossible not to feel empathy for the two main ones (two women) and the very last sentence of the book always leaves me breathless.”

## **South Korean Indie-pop: LUCY (2020)**

Katharina from Germany says: “Their band is named after a dog, they have a violinist and a drummer that sings as well. Sometimes refreshing and bubbly, yet also soothing music that just makes me feel happy and peaceful.”

## **Music: Zibuokle Martinaityte**

Ariana from Finland says: “I have been listening to a lot of [Zibuokle Martinaityte](https://open.spotify.com/album/2qW2MMrRatTxtJTArA1Sol) lately. Her work is splendidly orchestrated and admirably patient. Definitely recommend listening to her Horizons, Millefleur and Saudade.
