Mexico has finally lost its patience with the United Nations and on August 22, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced that he would be filing a formal complaint with the organisation regarding its failure to honour its commitment to supply the country with 10 million COVID-19 vaccines.

The frustration only increased as the week went on, even as the World Health Organisation offered to ship over some of the owed vaccines.

Deputy Health Minister Hugo López-Gatell went as far as threatening the United Nations with a lawsuit: “So far a little more than 24 million doses have been delivered and we have $76 million outstanding.”

He pointed out. “We have been requesting, requesting and requesting for almost a year to be given the doses that correspond to us … there’s been frustration and great dissatisfaction... The government of Mexico reserves the right to undertake any action, including legal, if this commitment is not fulfilled.”

Obrador also lamented that a “renovation of those international bodies” was well “overdue,” and he accused the UN of shirking its responsibilities.

“International bodies, such as the UN,” he said, “have not wanted to confront the grave problem of inequality and corruption in the world. So that’s why there is migration, that’s why there is violence …”
