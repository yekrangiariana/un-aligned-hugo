UN-aligned is excited to announce a new opportunity for its readers to nominate any individual or organisation whom they believe deserves more attention for championing their cause. Although the prize can go to literally anyone, we encourage you to think twice before nominating dictators, fascists or possibly your grandmother. 

After we have received the final results, we will shortlist your submitted names. An appointed executive committee, who will consist of UN-aligned staff and editors of the Gordian, will decide on the final winner. 

The UN-aligned Person of the Year will receive full coverage of their activities, life stories as well as their struggles and ambitions on our website and the Gordian Magazine.  

## **Who can be nominated?**

You can nominate any one individual who you think can use a welcome boost for their activism. 

## **How can I nominate my candidate?**

We will hold an online poll so that both our readers and members will be able vote for whom they believe deserves the UN-aligned Person of the Year award.

## **Why the person of the year?**

Too often we have felt that prestigious prizes for various activities [go to the wrong people](https://un-aligned.org/united-nations-critic/the-2020-nobel-peace-prize/) and are simply misplaced. This year has also not been a particularly good year for oppressed causes of advocates of peace, environment and human rights.

We hope that UN-aligned person of the year award will provide a boost and encouragement to struggling activists.
