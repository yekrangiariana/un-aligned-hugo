Last Friday’s successful launch marks a new milestone in the world of politics, getting us ever closer to a world that works for and belongs to everyone. What makes this event so important is that UN-aligned doesn’t aim to make changes within our broken political systems, but aims to change the global framework itself as its primary goal.  

### **UN-aligned is about peace, prosperity and stability**    

UN-aligned is an organisation that aims to create long lasting peace, prosperity and stability among its member states, which is not based on the self-indulgent interests of superpowers and their wealth. Instead, the plan is to make our economies, politics and people so closely interconnected that nationalistic secessionist sentiments would become both impractical and unthinkable.

**What is Next?**

At the first stage we laid the groundwork for a [manifesto](https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/) that consists of basic ethical norms. We believe a modern political system should not only abide by them, but also make sure they are not thrashed by democratic votes, referendums or national constitutions. Therefore, UN-aligned’s aim for the next few years will consist of promoting our manifesto within our [parishes](https://un-aligned.org/members/structure-main-bodies/), collaborating with like-minded organisations and campaigning for the need of a virtual and alternative United Nations.  

At a later stage, when a national branch has enough members and resources to take the leap from the virtual to the real world, this will happen with the support of the whole organisation. Should two or more national parties be elected in government, these may join into a federal partnership for the duration of their mandate in accordance with the UN-aligned’s manifesto.  

### **Conclusion:**  

In the past two months alone, we received the generous support of members from more than 12 countries around the globe, many of whom offered their strong and continuing support for UN-aligned.  

One observer wrote:

“As an individual passionate about human rights, I've found myself having the same thoughts that has led to the creation of UN-aligned. Very happy to know something is being done, and eager to see where this organisation is going.”  

Unity is force and this is hardly a secret. The United States of America, The European Union and China have known this since their foundation. In a world of shifting superpowers, we hardly stand a chance if we decide to be alone. Nationalistic sentiments are no longer justified or sufficient as the carnage of the last century suggests that they produce few, if any, lasting winners.
