While the global political scene is beginning to look more and more like a Theatre of the Absurd, UN-aligned has become an alternative platform for many to turn to. This is not surprising; long lasting peace and prosperity can only be achieved with the kind of values and principles that UN-aligned advocates.  

Last month, UN-aligned continued to grow, develop and change according to the needs of its members: we now have an exciting design for the user’s [dashboard](https://un-aligned.org/dashboard/) interface, a brand new logo and, finally, we are starting the creation of our own UN-aligned App.  

#### **The new dashboard UI**

We believe that our members are part of the initial dream that will be taking UN-aligned forward into the world arena, therefore it is incumbent upon us to create an attractive platform for you, our members, to interact with. The new user interface (UI) features a set of new pages such as a [Language Course](https://un-aligned.org/dashboard/language-courses/), a [Virtual Library](https://un-aligned.org/dashboard/virtual-library/) and much more, all of which are, of course, completely free to use.   

Get the most out of your UN-aligned membership. If you haven’t seen the new dashboard yet, we strongly recommend you do so right now. [Visit Dashboard](https://un-aligned.org/dashboard/).

#### **Our new logo**

We have been incredibly impressed by Amaya’s new design and we absolutely love it.

The logo has quite an ease to it; the motion and energy that it has implies trust and a strong will, which sums up what UN-aligned is really about. 

A big thank you to _Amaya Libreto_ for putting her time and soul into her contribution.  

#### **The new APP**

Our developer team is working hard on the first sketches for a fresh looking App that will make interacting with UN-aligned easier than ever. If you have any suggestions or recommendations for the app, please don’t hesitate to [contact us](https://un-aligned.org/about/who-are-we/register/).
