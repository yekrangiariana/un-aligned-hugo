So far The Gordian magazine has been presented in a PDF format sent to your email on a monthly basis. While this may have been perfect for readers who printed our magazine on traditional paper or those who used computer devices with bigger screens, such as laptops or tablets, mobile users often had to pinch and zoom on a specific section of the page in order to see a paragraph of text. For this reason, we have decided to change the way The Gordian magazine is presented for a temporary period of time.Â 

As of April 2020 to June 2020, all of Gordian magazine issues will be available on a web page rather than a PDF file.

We hope that the this change will help our readers to:

- Have a more mobile-friendly experience when reading the magazine.
- Improve the way they interact with the monthly quiz.
- Access every issue of the magazine instantly and from anywhere.

We also believe that this change will allow us to:

- Make the magazine accessible to people with disabilities.
- Make changes to the magazine if and when they are needed.

We kindly invite you to [tell us](https://un-aligned.org/about/who-are-we/register/) what you think about this change and what we can do to improve your experience of reading [The Gordian](https://un-aligned.org/the-gordian/).
