The festival of Pir Shalyar is an old traditional ceremony in Kurdistan associated with the pre-Islamic, Zoroastrian times. It is held on the 40th day of winter.

Pir (also translated as saint), Shaliyar is believed to have cured the daughter of the king of Bukhara; the ceremony intends to mark their marriage.

[Uraman Takht](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/uraman-takht-a-journey-to-the-forgotten-lands-of-kurdistan/), the city hosting the festival, is located in the eastern part of Marivan, Kurdistan.

The Kulla Ball is a vest that is made of fleece and does not require sewing. This vest dates back several thousand years in the history of Horaman. In Horaman, if a ruler was powerful yet just, the men wore kulla balls without ears (shoulder pads), but if the ruler deviated and did not serve the land and its people, the men wore kulla balls with earmuffs and demanded to overthrow the throne.

An old lady is saying her prayers with a rosary. With a kind look on her face, she wants me to take a picture of her. When I show her the photo on the camera monitor, she tells me that her eyesight is too weak for her to see the photo, but she encourages me to continue being happy, claiming that she can see that!
