As the Environmental Priorities Series comes to its sixth and last issue, we sincerely thank all of our readers and authors for their generous support and contributions. It is because of you that The Gordian magazine has developed into its current form and has become a platform for members to express their thoughts and ideas.

We are incredibly proud of this achievement and will continue our efforts to improve this resource with the support of our members and contributors.

The last past issues of Environmental Priorities explored key topics relating to environmental issues, in each episode we took one major crisis or shock under the microscope:

1. Wildfires: [issue 1](https://un-aligned.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ISSUE-1VOL.2-1.pdf)
2. The Sixth mass extinction: [issue 2](https://un-aligned.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ISSUE-2VOL.2-2.pdf)
3. Pharmaceutical companies: [issue 3](https://un-aligned.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ISSUE-2VOL.3.pdf)
4. Humanity’s abuse of water resources: [issue 4](https://un-aligned.org/the-gordian-magazine/the-gordian-april-issue/)
5. The rise of sea levels: [issue 5](https://un-aligned.org/the-gordian-magazine/the-gordian-may-issue-vol-2/)

## **Introducing the new Human Rights series:**

Clarifying and upholding human rights is a fundamental duty of states and citizens. The new series on Human Rights intends to bring light to topics that don’t get enough coverage. 

We are very proud of what the UN-aligned’s [Human Rights manifesto](https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/human-rights-2/) already covers and we hope that this series will put our articles in context and provide some real-life examples of what our manifesto must strive to achieve.

## **Help us to cut the Gordian knot:**
