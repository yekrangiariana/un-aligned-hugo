## **When People Gather**

The news is published everywhere  
It tells us the world is in disrepair  
Maybe you turn and pretend it's not there  
Maybe you consume the news in despair  
Maybe you say that you're not political  
What a privilege you have, that's not typical!  
Things only seem to get worse by the day  
Floods and plagues, corruption, decay  
While thoughts and prayers might be a gesture  
Stand up, be proactive or the problems fester  
These are man-made issues and ours to undo  
Where do we start? You haven't a clue.  
"Well there's nothing that just I can do"  
But what if your neighbour thought that too?  
And their neighbour thought they didn't matter  
Changes happen when people gather
