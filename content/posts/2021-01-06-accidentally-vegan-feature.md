If you’ve pondered veganism but haven’t yet followed through, it may be that you are put off by the myth of the diet being restricted. As with any lifestyle change, slow and steady tends to lead to longevity. It is much better to gradually cut animal products from your diet permanently than trying to be a strict vegan for a month, falling off the wagon, and being put off enough to never try it again.

While making some snack swaps, it can be comforting to know that there are many products, which we can call ‘accidentally vegan’. They are not marketed in this way as their core selling point, but they do not contain animal products.

This makes them more accessible since you do not need to visit a specialist shop to have a choice of vegan snacks.

This list is prefaced by pointing out that it may not be the most nutritious collection of vegan snacks, but they will help in a pinch.

1. Ritz crackers
2. Doritos sweet-spicy chilli chips
3. Oreo original
4. Belvita breakfast Tops Choco-Hazelnut
5. Pringles Original flavour & BBQ flavour
6. Frys Peppermint cream bar
7. Ritter Sport Marzipan

10. All savoury Ryvita Crunchy Rye bread flavours (excluding Fruit Crunch)
