According to the Palestinian health authorities, during the recent clashes between Israel and Gaza, at least 254 Palestinians including 66 children were killed. This is while more than 1,900 are reported to be wounded. 

For 30 years, the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund (PCRF), a nonpolitical humanitarian relief organisation, has provided the children of Gaza with free medical care. However, on the 17th of May, their main Gaza office was arbitrarily targeted by the Israeli military. 

Hence, now more than ever, the Palestinian Children’s Relief Fund needs your support. If you are in a position to financially contribute to the PCRF and its activities, please click [here](https://pcrf1.z2systems.com/np/clients/pcrf1/donation.jsp?campaign=1680) to access their website.   

While fundraising is important, it is only the first step: donations alone can never help to end the blockade. They won’t end the occupation and they won’t end the apartheid.

Please also consider becoming a free member of UN-aligned; your support will allow us to have a greater impact in combating injustice around the world and work towards a fairer United Nations.
