## **Learning a thing or two from Taiwan…**

Taiwan gave the world a lesson in real democracy last month when same-sex marriage was legalised in the “country“. In a referendum last November, 72% of the population had voted against allowing same-sex marriage.

Two years earlier, however, Taiwan’s supreme court had ruled that limiting the definition of marriage to couples of the opposite sex was unconstitutional. Legislators therefore backed the Government Bill, putting justice before numbers. This is real democracy.

## **Might is not right and nor are numbers**

Might is not right and nor are numbers  
Numbers cannot change something that is wrong into something that is right. Prejudice against the LGBTQ is rampant around the world. Its prevalence does not make it right. Quite the contrary, it makes it even more vicious.

The same applies to all breaches of human rights; and there are many. Those that hide behind religions are particularly pernicious. Taiwan itself is a whole nation whose rights have been abused by the international community. So many numbers; and yet, so wrong.

See how [UN-aligned](https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/) is campaigning for a fairer democracy.
