[In a recent publication](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/how-to-prevent-the-food-crisis-of-2021/), UN-aligned joined the voices of organisations, like Oxfam and the WFP, in warning against a hunger catastrophe already targeting millions of children and adults in the world’s most vulnerable places. The good earth is rich and can provide for everyone and in our world of plenty, no one should have to suffer hunger or malnutrition.  

The solid frame-work the sustainable development goals provided during the last decade is threatened by an awful melange of disasters, such as Covid-19 and climate change. If no action is taken, many lives will be lost. Some estimates by Oxfam suggest up to 12,000 people could die every day as a result of hunger. 

UN-aligned calls upon its members to use the template below to contact their local MPs or representatives and challenge them on this extraordinary issue. You could encourage Official Development Assistance (ODA) donors, especially those to Africa and Asia, to increase their support as encouraged by Ceres2030, a sustainable solution to end hunger by 2030. 

For obvious reasons, UN-aligned is unable to send these messages on such a large scale. Moreover, we believe that citizens of countries will be in a better position to challenge their governments on their actions and spending plans.

Forward the following letter to your MP or local representative. **Please remember to change the information inside the brackets.**

Dear **\[name of MP or representative\]**,  
  
Recently, I have been made aware of a food crisis that is exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic and global warming. The pandemic is the final straw for millions of people already struggling with the impacts of conflicts, climate change, inequality and a broken food system that has impoverished millions of food producers and workers.  
  
Ceres2030’s research is backed by the German Government. It provides donor governments with a menu of policy options for directing their investments as well as the best innovative interventions.  
  
The study reads that: “An estimated 690 million people are hungry and it is predicted that a further 95 million people will be living in extreme poverty and hunger as a result of COVID-19. Perversely, the very people whose livelihoods depend on food and agriculture are among the most likely to experience hunger.” A pdf copy of the report is available here: [Ceres2030](https://www.bmz.de/de/zentrales_downloadarchiv/themen_und_schwerpunkte/ernaehrung/Ceres2030_summary.pdf)  
  
A link to UN-aligned’s report, where I learned about this issue is also available here: [https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/how-to-prevent-the-food-crisis-of-2021/](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/how-to-prevent-the-food-crisis-of-2021/)  
  
UN-aligned is an international organisation that laid the foundations for an alternative United Nations, which aims to serve people before nationstates.  
  
I want my country to support the development of sustainable agricultural production and food value chains, land management and the organisation of small-scale farmers, as highlighted by the Ceres2030 report. It is imperative that the government should take action before it is too late. As an official Development Assistance donor, this country must be accountable not only to its own people, but also to the global community.   
  
The sustainable development goal to eradicate hunger must not, and cannot, be postponed. It is for this reason that I ask you to support and back the Ceres2030 study and its 10 key recommendations on the sort of interventions that will prove effective.   
  
Having read the information in this letter, please let me know exactly what actions you are going to take, on behalf of your constituents, to address this profoundly serious and disturbing issue.   
  
I await your reply.  
  
Yours sincerely,  
**\[write your name\]**
