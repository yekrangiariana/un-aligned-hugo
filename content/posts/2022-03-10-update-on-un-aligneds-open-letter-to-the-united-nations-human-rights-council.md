In the second half of 2021, we launched an [Open Letter](https://un-aligned.org/letters/counties-who-criminalise-homosexuality-must-not-be-allowed-a-seat-on-the-unhrc/) to the United Nations Human Rights Commission requesting that countries that criminalise LGBTQ+ rights be barred from forming part of the commission. 

So far, the letter has been signed by over a dozen LGBT+ organisations from around the globe, as well as individual activists. We originally planned to send the letter on 22 February 2022. However, owing to the latest developments in the United Nations and the ongoing war in Ukraine, we have decided to postpone the open letter as otherwise it would be sounded out by these tragic events. 

We are currently working on a new action plan for the campaign and will update you accordingly. 

- **If you have signed this campaign,** thank you so very much. 
- **If, for any reason, you haven't signed the campaign yet,** please consider doing so. Whether you agree with all of UN-aligned’s principles or not, is not the issue here. This is not about us, but about the UN’s failure to take its mandate seriously by cosying up to governments that flout basic human rights.

In any case, be assured that UN-aligned will continue to champion the rights of the LGBTQ+ community all around the world. We truly believe that far from upholding human rights, the current policy at the United Nations Human Rights Council makes a mockery of them and it must change immediately. 

If there is any other way you could help us make our letter more impactful, please let us know. We would really appreciate any help we can get in this regard.
