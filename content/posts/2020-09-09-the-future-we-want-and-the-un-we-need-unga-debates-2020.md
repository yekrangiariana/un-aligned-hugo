### **What are the United Nations General Assembly Debates?**

Every year, in September, all 193 Member States of the United Nations who are represented in the General Assembly come together to discuss a wide array of international issues covered by the Charter of the United Nations, such as development, peace, security and international law.

### **UN-aligned will be watching the developments of this event closely**

In the live blog from last year’s United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Adrian Liberto and I summarised some of the most important speeches that unfolded during this four-day event. We even [awarded some of the speeches](https://un-aligned.org/united-nations-critic/an-assembly-that-is-stuck-in-time/) for their courage and relevance.

This year, this is not going to be any different. We are committed to go through every speech and deliver to you the most important updates in a variety of different subjects including: Trade, World Peace, Inequality, Global Warming and most importantly, UN Reforms.

### **Help us cover the events:**

Believe it or not, you can learn alot from listening to speeches given at the UNGA. I was surprised to learn how little I knew about crucial problems around the globe that are so obscure that they often don’t make it into mainstream media.

Moreover, as you can probably imagine, most people don’t have the time or patience to sit through hours of boring speeches in order to try to keep updated with important news that directly correlates with their welfare and well-being.

This is why we would like to ask you to join our team in converting these speeches into a more accessible format. If we want the UN to change, we must first understand it.

We promise you that this opportunity will teach you a great deal about:

1. The outstanding work the UN staff does and how little it achieves.
2. The importance of committing to multilateralism.
3. Learning about the UN system and why it is time for it to change.
4. The significance of UN-aligned in today’s world.

UN-aligned is not interested in your money, we need active members: people who roll up their sleeves and contribute to the work of the organisation to make the United Nations a platform that serves everyone. No matter what you can do, we want you. Write to us with your talents and we’ll make it work. 

Here are some suggested activities:

- Proofreading
- Design
- Writing
- Assisting with Publication
- Video Editing

### **How can I receive the latest updates?** 

If you are subscribed to the UN-aligned newsletter you will automatically receive a daily overview of the debate. If you are not subscribed visit our website to do so.

You can also see a full list of the updates on our live blog which will start once the first speeches have been given.

The 2020 UNGA summit will start on the 21st of September 2020 and it’s theme, “The Future We Want and the UN We Need”, will give UN-aligned a chance to shine.
