This Hercules originating from The Giustiniani collection is a patchwork composed of fragments of different ancient statues with some recent additions.


![](/images/17-Aphrodite-and-Eros-762x1024.jpg)

This group consisting of Aphrodite, Eros and Ketos (Cetus) belonged to the Giustiniani collection. It dates back to the first half of the 2nd century CE, although the goddess’s head was a later addition. The Ketos was the sea monster that was slain by Perseus in order to save Andromeda.

![](/images/23-Man-and-Girl--768x1024.jpg)

The man’s head, known as Euthydemus of Bactria from the Giustiniani collection (late 3rd-early 2nd century BCE) was originally thought to represent a peasant because of his rough features, however the consensus is now veering towards the idea that this “Euthydemus” was a probably a person of some distinction. By contrast, the girl, carved in white marble, (c. 40-50 BCE) is particularly refined.
