## [**Meet The New Lady Justice**](https://un-aligned.org/the-gordian-magazine/gordian-may-issue-vol-6/)

The Gordian Magazine, issue 1, volume 6


In issue one, we critised the traditional image of lady justice. Her blindfold is supposed to symbolise impartiality, however, one cannot help comparing the blindfold to that of “blind” Fortune, whose largess is purely random. How else can there be so much injustice in the world? We said no more and introduced our readers to a new Lady Justice.

The Gordian Magazine, issue 2, volume 6


In keeping with our theme, issue two, focused on appeasement and how it is like forfeiting somebody else’s justice.

In Issue three, we talked about justice across the European block. Though the organisation is a remarkable institution, its callous exclusivity has risked making it a gentlemen’s club, whose head is very much up its own backside.

The Gordian Magazine, issue 4, volume 6


In issue four, we focused on justice and punishment, including those phoney ones imposed on the guilty with little or no respect for their welfare and human right.

## [**Dismantling the war machine**](https://un-aligned.org/the-gordian-magazine/gordian-october-issue-vol-6/)

In the fifth issue, we wrote about the futility of war and how to make it redundant. People and nations may disagree, and they may commit crimes, but these antagonisms can be resolved in countless ways. War should never be an option.

## [Enough is Enough: Time to Enforce Justice](https://un-aligned.org/the-gordian-magazine/gordian-december-issue-vol-6/)

The Gordian Magazine, issue 5, volume 6


The main theme of this volume is still justice, but we will also focus on a fight for justice that is unfolding in front of our eyes. Despite the brutality of the security forces in Iran, protests continue to thrive and grow. The courage and defiance of women is inspiring, and their determination to stand up for their rights is a testament to their strength and resilience.

## **New series on Utopia** 

An ideal society is like a magnificent temple, but temples cannot be built without vision, without plans, without resolve.

So what would your ideal world look like? UN-aligned would like to tweak its vision for the future with the support of its members and it will be launching a monthly series within The Gordian, which it hopes to publish as an individual work in the future.
