title: "The Noble Bukhara: A UNESCO Gem - in pictures"
description: "Walking the ancient streets of Bukhara in Uzbekistan is like being sucked into the pages of One Thousand and One Nights: mosques, madrasahs and markets follow you wherever you go, while the smells and ancient hues add to the dreaminess of the place. However, there is no Scheherazade here and you will have to weave your own stories. Years of Soviet rule appears to have left a wedge between Bukharaâ€™s history and its people."
