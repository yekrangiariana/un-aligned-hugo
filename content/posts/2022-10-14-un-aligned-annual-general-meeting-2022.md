We are pleased to invite you to UN-aligned’s 2022 Annual General Meeting.

The Annual General Meeting is a special occasion for the exchange of information and discussion between UN-aligned members across the world. 

It is also an opportunity for you to express yourself and play an active role in the major decisions of the organisation.

Below you will find the agenda and instructions on how to participate in this meeting.

I would like to thank you, on behalf of the UN-aligned Board, for the confidence and trust you have put in UN-aligned and I look forward to seeing you in the meeting on Friday, October 14th, 2022.
