For the first time in my life, I discovered a truthful and genuine smile in the poor areas of Nepal and India. From a distance you may only see men, women, and children who live in squatter areas or even on the streetsides, but when you get closer, you see a special kind of joy in the occasional smiles of these people. These smiles may not last forever, but when they appear, they're as genuine as they can be. I call this the magic of Nepal and India.

It takes months, maybe years to understand and feel the essence of humanity here. Perhaps this the difference between a traveller and a tourist. Most tourists only have a superficial understanding of a place and its people, but travellers experience a part of their lives.

It takes months, maybe years to understand and feel the essence of humanity here. Perhaps this the difference between a traveller and a tourist. Most tourists only have a superficial understanding of a place and its people, but travellers experience a part of their lives. Yellow and orange flowers are a sign of respect for buddhists. This boy is happy to sell flowers and serve the temple in this way. © Anahita Ahmadi

Shangri la is an earthly paradise. It's long been known that this is the place where people rest in comfort and peace. If you are worthy and capable of finding it, you will receive all of its intellectual largess. Nepal is one of the best choices for finding your earthly paradise, Shangri-La. © Anahita Ahmadi

In October and November, women bring fruits and other food to the temple of the Hindu God Vishnu for eleven consecutive days. This allows them to serve their Gods, and acts as a way for these women to cleanse themselves spiritually. © Anahita Ahmadi

Nepal is a poor and untouched country. Its people, ranging from young to old, are pure of heart. They're real people with honest emotions and expressions. Sometimes you can stare directly into their souls and predict what's within them. © Anahita Ahmadi
