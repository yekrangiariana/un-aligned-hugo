All articles in the [UN-aligned manifesto](https://un-aligned.org/our-manifesto/) are important, but it is only natural that we will feel more attached to some rather than to others.

If you are particularly passionate about one of the articles in the manifesto, we would like you to consider becoming a voluntary Ambassador for that specific article.

The task will involve taking the standard and campaigning for that particular issue, with the full force of the organisation behind you. You will be giving guidance on how best to carry out this mission, as well as ongoing support. 

If you are interested in becoming a voluntary Ambassador, please write to us with a [letter of intent](https://un-aligned.org/about/contact/register/). You will only need to identify your chosen article and explain why you have chosen it and how you mean to promote it.

There is no closing date, and the position will be given to the first suitable applicant.

## **UN-aligned belongs to each and every member.**

Of course, there are many other ways you could become more involved, so please contact us with any ideas you may have. 

We want our members to take ownership of UN-aligned and to use it as a tool to bring about a fairer, healthier and happier world.

We are honoured to have you on board and we look forward to working together in order to steer the humanity towards a more positive direction.
