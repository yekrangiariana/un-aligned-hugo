This month marks the last issue of the 4th Volume of the Gordian Magazine.

Although it may not seem like much, to date we have published more than 25 issues of the Gordian, all of which can be [accessed for free](https://un-aligned.org/dashboard/). 

Words cannot express how grateful we are to the generous support of our writers, contributors and, you, our readers. Thank you for using this magazine as a platform to express your ideas for a better and fairer world. 

## **The 4th Volume was a notable series within our publication...** 

Our fourth volume contained articles on the shortcomings of UN justice, the failure of UN leadership to take concrete action and the lack of moral obligations of our modern-day economy. 

We also introduced: the monthly [UN in Focus series](https://un-aligned.org/category/un-in-focus/), in which we started to measure UN’s ethics in the light of UN-aligned’s standards; a [literary column](https://un-aligned.org/tag/literature/) overseen by _Alex Liberto_; a general culture section featuring various topics such as art, music, movies etc.; and our official monthly podcast, [The Gordian in Audio](https://podcasts.apple.com/fi/podcast/the-gordian-in-audio/id1567086657), which is now available on all podcast platforms. 

Access all of the issues of this volume for free.

## **New theme of the Gordian Magazine**

Next month, The Gordian will start a new series of articles that will focus on various social issues including: poverty and homelessness, healthcare, school bullying and others. 

## **The new “Blood on their hands” series** 

Next month we will start featuring a series of current world leaders and a sample of their crimes. These are the sort of people whose representatives are allowed to vote on life and death issues at the United Nations. These are people who are involved in defining the moral path humanity should be taking. 

How can one support the United Nations without condoning a system that is swayed by such corrupt individuals? 

UN-aligned members are not complicit in this mockery of justice. We believe people deserve better and we have set the ball rolling in the right direction, one that prioritises ethical principles rather than kowtowing to power at all costs. 

We believe in a “United Nations” that is united around humane values and not simply united for the sake of a world club whose sole purpose is to pay lip service to peace and prosperity, while in practice member States do precisely what they please.
