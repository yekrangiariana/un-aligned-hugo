Welcome to the July 2022 issue of The Gordian. 

It was obvious to most that civilisation shall have had to deal with far more than a war of aggression after one of Putin’s casual malign interferences around the world morphed into an unscrupulous war in [Ukraine](https://un-aligned.org/tag/ukraine/). A social and economic crisis was, perhaps, expected. Four months on, however it is clear that we are heading towards far worse: an orgy of human rights violations spearheaded by unsavoury governments and bureaucrats who are supposed to protect the rule of law and human dignity.

Despite this, the Gordian Magazine remains emboldened by UN-aligned’s vision for an alternative [United Nations](https://un-aligned.org/category/un-in-focus/) that would leave the alphabet soup of tepid condemnations aside and take action to protect human rights, animal rights, environmental protection and, ultimately, do what it was created to do: secure world peace. Make no mistake, this magazine will not be pussyfooting around any topic.

In keeping with our theme for this volume, we will be focusing on justice. This month, our cover story examines the [European Union's Golden Curtain](https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/does-the-eu-stand-on-the-side-of-justice/): though a remarkable institution, the callous exclusivity of the block has risked making the Union a gentlemen’s club, whose head is very much up its own backside. The question we aim to answer is whether the EU is on the side of justice.

Of course, we also offer the usual mix of articles from various writers. Some of these include the recent US Supreme Court’s backtracking on abortion rights and what this means for women, America’s seriuos problem with [lobbying](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/lobbyland-the-story-of-american-lobbying-and-campaign-donations/) and campaign donations, why Australia needs to [legalise drugs](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/australia-needs-to-legalise-drugs/) and a gallery timeline of [Finland’s troubled history](https://un-aligned.org/gallery/finlands-troubled-history-with-russia-a-photo-timeline/) with Russia. Our coverage does not end here. Our popular features on [art](https://un-aligned.org/tag/art/), [literature](https://un-aligned.org/tag/literature/), [the environment](https://un-aligned.org) and general knowledge are all there as well. 

We hope you enjoy these stories and the many more in the following pages. Enjoy! 

Adrian Liberto and Ariana Yekrangi are the Editors of The Gordian Magazine.
