Many international organisations have warned about the worsening situation in Haiti, but some members of the United Nations were set on keeping the aid package to Haiti strictly humanitarian stating that they would let the Haitians solve their own political issues.

However, in the face of the growing threat to peace and security due to gang-related violence, hunger and an infrastructure crisis caused by several natural disasters, as well as the lack of proper medical equipment and personnel in response to the needs of the Haitian population amid several health emergencies such as the cholera outbreak, on October 21, 2022, the UN Security Council unanimously voted to establish a sanctions regime on Haiti to punish the actors responsible or complicit in actions that threaten peace, security, and financial stability in the region.

These sanctions come long after many have called for the UN to come to Haitiâ€™s aid, but the organisation decided to strictly provide humanitarian aid and refrain from taking steps to address the political issues in the region. Had these sanctions come earlier, that would have undoubtedly saved many lives or at least kept the situation from worsening as it has.
