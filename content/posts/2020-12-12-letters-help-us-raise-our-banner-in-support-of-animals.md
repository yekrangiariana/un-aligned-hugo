Hey members and readers! 

We need your assistance for our next publication of The Gordian, which will focus on ANIMAL RIGHTS. Please contribute material or ideas to ensure it will be a vibrant and interesting issue. 

Help us raise our banner in support of animals, who cannot speak for themselves other than with their eyes and screams; “words” most people are immune to. You could write an article, tell a story, write a poem, draw a picture… Anything that could add spice to the issue and bring the message home. 

Let’s rally together on this one and show our joint resolve. Let’s work as a team; let’s work together!

You can contact us [here](https://un-aligned.org/about/contact/).
