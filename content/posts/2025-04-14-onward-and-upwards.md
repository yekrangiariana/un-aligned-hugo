Standing by, while destructive, self-serving oligarchs destroy our planet and the international order, is not an option. UN-aligned's warnings about the dangers of the United Nations, in particular its dominance by the Five Permanent Members of the Security Council, could have proved prophetic, had the writing not been on the wall from the very beginning.

Despite some well-functioning aspects of the organisation and some remarkable people, like the Secretary General himself and the Special Rapporteur for Palestine, Francesca Albanese, who is truly outstanding, the structure of the organisation does not allow it to meet the dire challenges the world is facing in these unpresented times. We, “the people”, need to mobilise; make sure our voices are heard; we need to stand up for every citizen of this planet and the planet itself. In order to achieve this more effectively we are looking for dedicated people to join our Board and bring our mission forward according to the urgency the time demands. So, whatever your skills, please contact adrian.liberto@un-aligned.org to see how you can take on a leading role in UN-aligned and be at the forefront of our action.

The type of skills that could be particularly useful include writing, networking, training, mentoring, campaigning, website management and editing. Knowledge around human rights, animal welfare, environmental protection and international affairs would also be a great asset.

We need to add our voice and actions to those of others around the world, including those in the United Nations who have not forfeited their integrity under the pressure of bullying superpowers. In the spirit of Aaron Bushnell, we refuse to accept what the ruling elite want us to bow down to as the “new normal”. His sacrifice was ignored, so let our actions "fight the good fight", not with immolation, but with actions and words that will show the destroyers and warmongers that we will not "go gently" in their "good night".
