I urge the UN to swiftly refute such reports if they are false. UN reputation at stake." Tweet by Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba referring to an email by the United Nations to employees asking them to use "conflict" or "military offensive" when referring to Russia’s war on Ukraine.

10.03.22: “Can't get it out of my head that Europe cried about a 'migrant crisis' in 2015 against 1.4m refugees fleeing war in Syria and yet quickly absorbed some 2m Ukrainians within days, complete with flags and piano music.

Unless Putin is amputated, a fatal outcome is inevitable.”  Investment banker Serhij Fursa writing in NV (The New Voice of Ukraine).

24.03.22: “It is a shaky period really for the world at large. This war is not just a Ukraine war. This is a global war.” Amin Awad, the United Nations Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine in an interview with Shona Murray for Euronews, published today.
