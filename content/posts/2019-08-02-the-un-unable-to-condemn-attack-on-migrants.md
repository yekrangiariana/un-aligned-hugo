### **And so it continues…**

Migrants are once again the victims of indifference and direct aggression. Six children and about 50 adults were killed and more that three times as many were badly hurt when a migrant detention centre was bombed by the forces of General Khalifa Haftar who are fighting the UN recognised government of Libya. The site had clearly been designated as a UN sanctuary, but this made no difference. The attack that took place on the early hours of Wednesday, but reports are now coming to light that people were fired on as they tried to escape the bombardment.  No surprise there. Migrants are treated as sub-human even by those who have the responsibility of attending to them. 

### **The UN adds insult to injury**

In a Security Council special meeting yesterday, the members failed to condemn to attack, apparently owing to US opposition to the condemnation. No surprise there either. Today about 80 migrants died when their boat capsized near Tunisia. The tragedy goes on and on while the UN is paralysed by its inept mechanisms.  People are dying: again and again and again… We cannot stand back and let such a hollow organisation be the mouthpiece of out moral obligations.

### **Changing the UN**

You have three options: 

1. Pretend everything is all right
2. Admit the UN is a big mess and do nothing about it
3. Work for a better UN

UN-aligned is dedicated to the third option. It may not be perfect, but at least it is trying. Perhaps it is the only organisation whose main goal is to change the UN for the better and from the outside with something completely new. Change cannot come from within because the UN procedures and structures are too flawed.

A new United Nations is needed and that is what UN-aligned is striving for. Why not help us? You can help by [joining UN-aligned](https://un-aligned.org/register/). You can help by making its mission more robust and its message more visible. And finally, you can help by adding your personal magic and your passion to this noble mission.
