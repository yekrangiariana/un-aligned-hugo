Despite the “business as usual” attitude of most of the world’s politicians and the people the media like to keep in the spotlight, the genocidaires are hurting. The protests, the immolations, the hunger strikes, the courageous acts of defiance… They are slowly taking their toll. The genocidaires know that even if they managed to kill every single Palestinian living in Gaza and the West Bank, they will always be branded as mass-murderers. And now, on the first day of June, another remarkable challenge: Greta Thunberg and other 11 activists have set sail towards Gaza on the Madleen, a small ship operated the Freedom Flotilla, to dent the siege and raise “international awareness” to the atrocities that are being committed by Israel. Speaking before her departure, the brave activist acknowledged the dangers involved, but equally the more insidious risks of doing nothing: “Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it’s not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide.” Activists on board include “Game of Thrones” actor Liam Cunningham and French member of the European Parliament Rima Hassan. They are expected to reach Gaza in about a week’s time. Unsurprisingly, haughty critics soon attacked from their Pro- Zionist ivory towers. Republican senator Lindsey Graham, sneered: “Hope Greta and her friends can swim!”; while Brendan

O'Neill, writing in an opinion piece in the Dailly Telegraph, bent over backwards to disparage Thunberg and what he termed a “watery clown show”, while defending Israel’s actions. “Of all the smug stunts of the faux-virtuous activist class,” he ranted, “this is surely the most preposterous.” Clearly, the stunt is working. Thunberg and her band have proved to have more gumption than all our leaders put together, be they political or religious. They are another voice that will not accept what is being forced on us as a “new normal”.
