## Bloody motives!

If an angel came and told me that all the world problems would be solved if I just put a few bombs around killing innocent people in mosques, synagogues, churches, market places or hotels… would I do it? Of course not. Firstly, because I do not even have the right to insult an innocent person, let alone take their life. Secondly, because it would be like asking me to believe that good is founded on evil, or harmony on hatred. Rather obvious, you would say… Then why, oh why, does it keep happening again and again!

The answer is obvious. These people care little about harmony and justice. Their motives are greed, power and contempt for all that is sacred in this world. I am not talking about the gullible fools that let themselves be brainwashed. People too stupid to know that they are being manipulated by forces way beyond their comprehension. I am referring to the scheming scoundrels who pull the strings. Often, we haven’t got a clue who these people are, since the strings they are pulling may be long indeed. We could be dealing with the arms trade, geo-politics or single megalomaniacs, bent on power or profit. Often they exploit native bigotry for their aims.

## Silence is not an option

The way to improve the situation is also obvious. Religious and ideological leaders must stress the unacceptability of violence and injustice as a means to an end. This has to be proclaimed clearly and loudly. It has to be done as clarification of specific doctrines, but also in unity. These moral leaders must emphasise the fact that what unites us is greater than what divides us and that nothing justifies aggression against any innocent party. Religions can be beautiful, just as differing political perspectives can be, but when these do not decry violence, they too are tarnished. It is high time the predominant ideologies of the world start focusing on what is truly important, rather than on petty differences in doctrine or ideology.
