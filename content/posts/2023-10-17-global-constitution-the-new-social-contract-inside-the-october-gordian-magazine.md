As October’s chill sets in, ‘The Gordian’ returns from its brief hiatus with a meticulously curated issue titled ‘Global Constitution: The New Social Contract.’ This edition seeks to weave together the intricate threads of geopolitics, art, culture, and science, presenting a cohesive narrative of our shared global destiny.

In ‘_The Imagined Unity_: Understanding Nations, Nationalism and Their Bedrock,’ Alexander Stoney offers an exploration of the [nuanced concept of ‘Nation’.](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/nations-nationalism-and-their-bedrock/) This sets the stage for Adrian Liberto’s discourse on the pressing need for a global constitution in [‘_The Global Constitution: And Why we Need it_.’](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/the-global-constitution-and-why-we-need-it/) Liberto subsequently scrutinises the UN’s role in the Palestinian crisis in [‘Palestine and the UN: Will this 794th letter jolt the Security Council into action?’](https://un-aligned.org/un-in-focus/palestine-and-794-letters-to-unsc/)

Stoney returns with ’24 Years of Missed Opportunities: How the UN Failed to Secure Peace in the DRC,’ presenting [a critique of the UN’s endeavours in the Democratic Republic of Congo.](https://un-aligned.org/un-in-focus/how-the-un-failed-to-secure-peace-in-the-drc/) Sunil Kumar Pariyar, in a conversation with Stoney, brings forth the [struggles and aspirations of the Dalit community in Nepal](https://un-aligned.org/climate-emergency/sunil-pariyar-on-dalit-and-danar-impact-in-nepal/) in ‘_Redefining Forest Boundaries_.’

Yekrangi’s commentaries on Armenia’s diplomatic shifts in [‘_Armenia’s ICC Pivot: Defying Russia and Eyeing European and Iranian Ties_‘](https://un-aligned.org/explainer/armenias-icc-pivot-defying-russia-and-eyeing-european-and-iranian-ties/) and the Tories’ selective criticism in [‘The Selective Outrage of the Tories: HS2 and Beyond’](https://un-aligned.org/comments/the-selective-outrage-of-the-tories-hs2-and-beyond/) provide readers with a pulse on the shifting sands of geopolitics.

Dawn Roy delves into the broader ramifications of [Uganda’s Anti-Homosexuality Act,](https://un-aligned.org/human-rights/could-ugandas-anti-gay-law-alter-the-lives-of-all-ugandans-straight-or-not/) while Omar Alansari-Kreger posits questions on the [efficacy of nuclear deterrence in today’s geopolitical climate.](https://un-aligned.org/global-issues/rethinking-nuclear-deterrence-geopolitical-bravado-or-our-obligation-towards-peace/)
