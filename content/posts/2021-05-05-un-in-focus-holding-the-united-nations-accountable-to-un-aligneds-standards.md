The United Nations is not just any organisation. It is meant to be the organisation par excellence, it is meant to represent humankind. However, the UN spreads itself so thinly it is no wonder that it struggles to meet many of its commitments.

We would like to introduce you to a new feature in The Gordian Magazine. Every month an exclusive piece will highlight the good, bad and the ugly of the events in the UN.

Although organisations like the UN Watch already monitor the activities of the United Nations, they do so by the yardstick of the UN’s “own charter''. Holding an organisation that lacks any trace of LGBTQ+ rights in its literature, an organisation that does not hold particularly high values for human rights, an organisation shackled by bullying superpowers is not sufficient nor beneficial. 

This is where UN in Focus will shine. We will hold the United Nations accountable to [UN-aligned’s standards.](https://un-aligned.org/manifesto/)

This series will expose the hypocrisies of self-serving members of the UN and will bring peace, human rights, solidarity and the environment once again to the top of the UN agenda. The first feature of this series was published in June 2021.
