As Trump and Netanyahu cosy up in Washington again with fresh talks on Gaza, one thing is certain: there is no Israeli atrocity, however diabolical, that the US will not back. Here I pick at Dorothy Shea’s narrative after yet another US veto blocking moves to put an end to the genocide. 

Yes, Dorothy Shea (acting US Representative at the UN), as you rightly suggest, your 4 June 2025 veto on the resolution to put an end to the carnage in Gaza comes as no surprise. Your country has not only undermined every possible attempt to stop the genocide, vetoing resolution after resolution, but is actively involved in perpetrating it. 

Every other country on the council supported the resolution, but once again your moral bankruptcy holds sway. You say that: “Any product that undermines our close ally Israel’s security is a nonstarter.” Well, is Israel your ally, or is it your master? What hold does it have on you that you would be willing to sell your nation’s soul so cheaply? 

You can no longer pretend to care about decency or human life and like the Nazis you consider yourselves beyond good and evil. You have subordinated the sacredness of life and the innocence of children to your self-interests and you are too drunk with power to realise the self-destructive seeds you are sowing. You add that "This resolution also draws false equivalence between Israel and Hamas." 

Trust me, everyone in their right mind knows that no such equivalency exists. With all Hamas’ faults, it does not even come close to the barbarism of Israel. Israel remains the oppressor, the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, whoever they may be, the oppressed. And no, Israel does not have the right to defend itself on stolen land and in stolen homes. 

It is a genocidal regime that is flouting international law in countless ways. It needs to be disbanded once and for all and all the criminals who supported these horrific murders, including you, must be put behind bars.
