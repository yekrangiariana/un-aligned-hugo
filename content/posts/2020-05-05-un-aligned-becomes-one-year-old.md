UN-aligned is one year old this month! The seed was sown some years ago in China and developed thanks to the dedication of like-minded people. We have gone from 22 Foundation Members to hundreds of followers from around the world: some are full members, others are subscribers, while many follow us on Facebook. To all our supporters, we wish to offer a big THANK YOU!

Unlike most organisations, UN-aligned is, primarily, its members. We are the New United Nations and though just a drop in the ocean, for now, we will carry on growing until we will become a force to be reckoned with! Our Mission Statement and Manifesto clearly indicate what we stand for, but they are not written in stone and with your help we hope to learn and evolve so that we can bring about the change that we know will make the world more sustainable and harmonious.  

Refinement has been much of what this first year was about, also thanks to suggestions and advice form members and interested parties. For instance, we have made the website more user-friendly and improved its speed; we have improved the monthly magazine, now called The Gordian, and added new features to it and we commenced delivering the free English online classes to all UN-aligned members.

## **Watch This Space!**

Now that we have consolidated our base and our structures, we are ready to launch into phase 2!

First, we are in the process of progressing from a Voluntary Association to a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO). This will give UN-aligned more clout and will make it easier for it to be represented at international forums. This will strengthen our activism and our presence on the global stage. As soon as our application is approved, we will be furthering our cause through a number of manifesto-related campaigns.

Second, we are about to launch the UN-aligned Publishing Site. The first book will be a critique of the United Nations and will offer suggestions on what should replace it (UN-aligned, of course!). The book should be out at the end of spring or early summer. All members will have access to the site, should they wish to publish their own works.

Finally, so far, we have managed without funds, however, we realise that some will be necessary in order to help us carry out our activities. We will therefore be opening an UN-aligned bank account that will be completely transparent and visible on the UN-aligned website. All proceeds from the first book will get the account started. Funds will be a bonus. We managed without funds so far, and we will continue whether we have them or not. What is certain is that we will not be harassing our members or potential members for donations as many NGOs tend to do. What we really want is your enthusiasm!

## **How you can help further**

We need members! The more of us there are, the more chance we have of achieving our aims. Help us by promoting membership to you friends or to people you think have similar values. If every member added another, membership would snowball and we would be unstoppable!

However, we also need active members: people who roll up their sleeves and contribute to the work of the organisation. Some already have, for instance, by writing articles for The Gordian, or offering to help with proofreading. A special thank you goes to you! Now that we are entering a new phase, the opportunities for action and fulfilment are vast. Please [come on board](https://un-aligned.org/register/)! We need you!
