Kamchatka sits in the far east of Russia with one arm brushing past Alaska and another reaching down to Japan.

A region famous for active volcanoes and a huge population of Brown bears.

Although Kamchatka has stunning nature, the territory can be hostile and dangerous for unprepared tourists, and those who are not local should travel with a guide for their own safety.
