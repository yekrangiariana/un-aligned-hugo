The government's treatment of workers and Unions asking for a fair pay rise during a cost of living crisis has been shameful. Nurses, ambulance drivers, paramedics, and other frontline workers have been demonised and blamed for the country's economic woes, despite their tireless efforts to keep the country running during a global crisis.

Meanwhile, those who have actually caused the economic damage – such as the former prime minister who blew a £30 billion hole in the economy overnight, the shambolic execution of Brexit that is estimated to have cost the country over £40 billion, the Tory government’s botched test and trace programme which costed £37 billion, their wasteful procurement of PPE resulting in £8.7 billion being wasted and ending up in the pockets of Tory donors and Richie Sunak’s decision to spend £11 billion by overpaying interest on UK debt – are allowed to escape accountability.

It's time for the government to stop gaslighting essential workers and give them the pay rise they deserve. The unions are not holding the country to ransom; they are fighting for fair treatment and decent working conditions. It's not too much to ask for after everything they have done for us during the pandemic.

Furthermore, the government's attempts to crackdown on peaceful protests and silence those who speak out against their mistreatment is an affront to British democracy. We must not allow this to happen. We must stand with essential workers and support their right to fair treatment and decent pay. It's time for the government to do the right thing and provide the support and recognition that essential workers deserve.
