Omid is a motorcyclist and his income comes from ferrying tourists around the island. He said that he was not too unhappy with the pandemic, explaining how he and his friends took advantage of the lack of tourists on the island. They bought a boat together and spent days fishing. He says, the joy of childhood days had returned to him. Photo by Anahita Ahmadi.

Women on Hormoz Island have to cover their face and body and because of this, you cannot know what kind of a personality lies behind their hijab. However, by carefully looking at their bare feet, you can learn much about their tastes and interests. Photo by Anahita Ahmadi.
