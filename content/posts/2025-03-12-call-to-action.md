Following a successful AGM, during which Adrian Liberto was confirmed as Chair and Partho Chatterjee as Vice-Chair, UN-aligned would like to highlight some of the priorities for the remainder of 2025. 

Our first priority is to bolster our membership board with dedicated members who can propel the organisation forward. The mission remains the same: the creation of a united nations that is fit for purpose, supported by inviolable values, rather than subservience to the self-interest of dominant member-states. This we are now prepared to do in collaboration with those sectors of the current United Nations that are not compromised beyond redemption. Â 

Our founding principles also remain the same, namely: world peace, human rights, environmental protection and animal welfare. Our next priority is to relaunch The Gordian, as the promotion of independent journalism is of utmost importance in this era of media manipulation by governments and the super-rich. 

Equally important, will be our campaigns, which we also plan to promote through the fostering of productive partnerships with focussed organisations. Combatting evils like genocide, environmental destruction and all kinds of injustice and prejudice will be at the fore of these campaigns. 

If you are as passionate as we are regarding these issues and if you have the time to support us in our mission, please get in touch ([adrian.liberto@un-aligned.org](mailto:adrian.liberto@un-aligned.org)). With all that is happening in the world at the moment, it is easy to give in to despondency; the remedy, however, is fighting back.
