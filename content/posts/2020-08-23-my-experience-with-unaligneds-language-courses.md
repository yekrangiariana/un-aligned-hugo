I accidentally discovered UN-aligned through a post on Facebook and then joined the community as I found it quite interesting and inspiring. I also thought that reading articles of interest, such as those relating to climate change, could help me improve my English.

I was amazed about the tutor's professionalism and wide range of knowledge.

As I desperately need to improve my English, I later also registered onto the English course. My tutor, Adrian, reached out to me soon after, and unexpectedly, this course turned out to be totally free! But what amazed me the most, was the tutor's professionalism and wide range of knowledge.

Lessons are very well-managed and materials used, such as TED talk videos, poems, short novels, articles, are deliberately selected by my tutor with my preference taken into consideration. During our sessions, the tutor will break down the parts that I find difficult and then we will have a discussion over it. To enhance my understanding and writing skills, we also started doing summarising and paraphrasing practices and like all other activities we are working on, it's been so helpful!

## **Learning could sometimes be difficult**...

Learning could sometimes be difficult, especially given I don't know much about foreign literature and history, but Adrian has always been a great support, not just because of his professionalism, but also his patience, kindness, and generosity in time, which are surely highly appreciated. A thousand times, "thanks, Adrian!".
