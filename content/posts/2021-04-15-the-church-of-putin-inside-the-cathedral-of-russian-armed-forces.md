There has long been a link between Russian banks and the Russian Orthodox Church, so for many it came as no surprise to learn that an extraordinary new cathedral was being built in the outskirts of Moscow costing allegedly 82 Million USD. Photo by Alexia James.

There is something to be said about the mixture of military and religious imagery. Some may consider it distasteful, while other patriots may view it as complimentary.

Photos were leaked showing Russian President Vladimir Putin and Joseph Stalin immortalized in mosaic inside the cathedral, however these were not present on the walls at opening.

The windows are sandwiched between murals depicting The Virgin Mary plus mosaics showing scenes from Russian military history, including the annexation of Crimea by Russia.

On the main floor, natural light pours in from the windows painted with Russian war medals.

Below the main floor of the cathedral sits a Baptismal font. It was one of the most decadent I have ever seen with mosaics and gold fixtures from floor to ceiling.

Russia has a plethora of churches scattered throughout the country, in some places there are well maintained churches on every corner. This one differed since it was erected to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. The exterior is made from a metal with a khaki- green hue. Supposedly, melted Nazi tanks were the material of choice.
