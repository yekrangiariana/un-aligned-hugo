UN-aligned is proud to announce the launch of a series of campaigns in line with its manifesto. UN-aligned campaigns will cover a range of issues concerning human rights, the environment and United Nations reform, and we will be reporting on them in The Gordian, as well as on our website.

Our campaigns will start by targeting blatant disregard to clearcut issues of social or environmental justice by powerful corporations, organisations or individuals. We will be highlighting their shortcomings and asking them to take positive steps in order to improve their undertakings in line with a fairer and safer world.

For instance, we will be contacting the Arab League and holding it to account for blocking UN initiatives to protect LGBT rights and we will be challenging the Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu and asking him to consider how he can justify preaching hatred against the Rohingya, when this goes against every tenet of Buddhist belief.

We are opening the cycle by turning the spotlight on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/) and its lacklustre packaging policy. Ruby Goldenberg, the new UN-aligned Senior Administrator, has written to Amazon offering feedback and suggestions for more effective and environmentally friendly practices. We have published her letter below and will be sharing developments and replies with our readers.

If you feel strongly about an issue and would like to confront it with the full support and backing of UN-aligned, please [let us know](https://un-aligned.org/about/contact/register/). Also, help us increase the impact of our campaigns by inviting like minded people to join UN-aligned as members. The bigger we become, the further will our voice travel and therefore the more we will be able to achieve.
