Seeing as the rival gangs are generally to blame, one cannot help wondering whether the government is happy to reduce its prison population by allowing these deadly interactions.

30.05.22: **Brazil**. Scores of people have died and many are missing as torrential rains are causing floods and mudslides in the northeast of the country.

## Europe

France Insoumise Group


04.05.22: **France**. The Socialist Party and the extreme-left party, La France Insoumise, have agreed to form an alliance, which may include other parties on the left of the political spectrum, in order to increase the left’s chances in the parliamentary elections due in June.

09.05.22: **UK**.  In a vote that could bring the prospect of the unification of Ireland closer, the nationalist Sinn Féin Party has won the most parliamentary seats (27) in the Northern Ireland Assembly, meaning that party leader Michelle O'Neill will be entitled to become First Minister. For this to happen, however, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which came second with 25 seats, would need to agree to share power according to protocols set in the 1998 Good Friday Agreement; however, it is unlikely to do so without huge concessions. This spells uncertainty for the governance of Northern Ireland in the immediate future.

12.05.22: **Finland**. President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Sanna Marin announced that they were in favour of applying for NATO membership "without delay,"

13.05.22: **Turkey, Finland & Sweden**. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan stated that he was not in favour of Finland and Sweden joining NATO, citing their support for Kurdish militants. Ingratiating himself to Putin, of course, may be one of the reasons behind his current stance, as well as gaining concessions from the alliance. All NATO decisions require a consensus by each of the 30 member countries, so Erdogan can effectively veto their membership.

16.05.22: **France**. Prime Minister Jean Castex has handed in his resignation in order to allow President Emmanuel Macron to overhaul his cabinet in preparation for the legislative elections in June.  Left-leaning Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne has already been picked as the new prime minister.

18.05.22: **Finland/Sweden**. Both countries formally applied to join NATO ending a history of neutrality thanks to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. While the application was warmly received by NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, the opposition to their membership by Turkey’s president still needs to be addressed.

25.05.22: **UK**.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson apologised to parliament saying that he was "humbled” and that he had “learned a lesson", but added that he would not quit.

28.05.22: **France**. Swedish director Ruben Östlund has won his second Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival for the social satire _Triangle of Sadness_. He won his first Palme d’Or in 2017 with his film _The Square_.

07.05.22: **Afghanistan**. The Taliban government has decreed that all women must be covered from head to toe. Whilst the Hijab would be permitted, the Burqa, which includes a laced covering for the eyes, was promoted as the preferred option. Punishments for breaking this law will be extended to their male “guardians”, which would immediately start with a three-day prison confinement. The United Nations condemned the move as another broken promise to respect human rights.

17.05.22: **Lebanon**. The results from Sunday’s general election have dealt a blow to Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies who have lost their parliamentary majority, with smaller parties gaining more seats. The results leave parliament split into several conflicting groups, a situation that will make forming a workable government very difficult.

23.05.22: **Myanmar**. At least 17 Rohingya, including children, have drowned over the weekend when their boat capsized as they were attempting to reach Malaysia and escape persecution by the military regime.
