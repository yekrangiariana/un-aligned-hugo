LED,  
Where is Dendrite?  
That Synapse - 

To my fiery colours of hope  
To feed my soul, To feel my soul  
To light my soul, To kiss my soul  
To light my fire  
To hear me  
To talk to me!  
Speech me - 

To hold me in words,  
To hold me in paint,  
To violins,  
To my treasures, to loves.  
Anode and Cathode before the dark - 
A light emitting diode,  
A neural implant, never was,  
To trigger years loves, laughter, dreams, memories, hope, passion;  
Pain, despair, angst, anxiety, fear - 
Fiery Colours of hope always. 

Womb me Nucleus, Soma, nuclear the death  
Neuron, circuit fading me. Fire.  
Nucleus stay  
Tangle Axon, Terminal me,  
Myelin Sheets, tango, to more sheets of life!  
Wrap me Myelin, embalm.  
Wake up Dendrite, Explode !Fire up.  
Dare you not die - Treason!  
Away Abeta,  
Else I fade to nothingness 

Oh Snap, Synapse - 
Light Emitting Diode. Disrupt. The Death. 

Light up brain,   
Kiss my soul, talk to me, hear me….- 
Light Emitting Diode.  
86 billion. Live.
