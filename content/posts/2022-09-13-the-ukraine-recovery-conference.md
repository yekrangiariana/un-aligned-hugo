United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres addressed the Ukraine Recovery Conference, which was held in Lugano Switzerland, on the 4th and 5th of July.

The event was attended by over 40 nations and nearly 20 international organisations who approved the Outcome Declaration, vowing support for Ukraine. It is estimated that the recovery plan is already worth $750 billion. The UN chief spoke boldly via a video link:

“Russia’s war in Ukraine has taken thousands of lives and forcibly displaced millions of people. Millions of Ukrainians have lost their livelihoods and 90% risk of falling into poverty.

The damage and devastation to homes, hospitals and schools will take years to rebuild…This is a long road, but it must start now.”

The words are all the more striking considering Russia, one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, is still hard at work trying to obliterate Ukraine.

One cannot fault Guterres, but at the same time, one cannot help comparing him to a spouse in an abusive relationship who does what they can to protect their children from constant harm, other than solving the problem once and for all by telling the abuser to piss off!
