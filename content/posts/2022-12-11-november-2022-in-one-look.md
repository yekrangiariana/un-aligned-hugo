António Guterres


“And the clock is ticking. We are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing. Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible. We are on a highway to climate hell with our foot still on the accelerator.”  
_Secretary-General_ **_António Guterres_** _in his opening speech of the COP27 on November 7._

“They have to accept our rules here. \[Homosexuality\] is haram. You know what haram means? \[...\] I am not a strict Muslim but why is it haram? Because it is damage in the mind.”  
_Former Qatari international footballer_ **_Khalid Salman_** _to a German reporter for a documentary aired on November 8._

“Jamal died again today”  
_A Tweet (November 18) by_ **_Hatice Cengiz_**_, the fiancée of murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after the US State Department granted immunity to Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS), now Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, despite Biden’s original pledge to put human rights before money.

“I’m European. For what we Europeans have been doing around the world in the last 3,000 years, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people,”  
_FIFA president_ **_Gianni Infantino_** _at a news conference in Doha on 19 November in which he accused those raising concerns about Qatar’s human rights record as “hypocrites”._

“It wasn’t about making a political statement – human rights are non-negotiable. That should be taken for granted, but it still isn’t the case. That’s why this message is so important to us.

Denying us the armband is the same as denying us a voice. We stand by our position.”  
_A Tweet by the_ **_German national football_** _team on November 23 regarding the ban by FIFA on their being able to wear the armband protesting human rights abuses in Qatar. They nevertheless still managed to make their point by posing for their pre-match photo while covering their mouths with their left hands._
