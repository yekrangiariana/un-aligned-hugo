Dugin, known as ‘Putin’s brain’ owing to his influence on the Russian leader, was due to travel in the vehicle, which belonged to him, but decided to opt for another at the last minute. His anti-Ukrainian and pro-invasion stance, which his daughter shared, has led Moscow to believe that Kiev was behind the attack.

Despite al-Sadr’s Sadrist Movement winning the most seats in the October elections, failure to win an overall majority meant that the formation of a new government depended on external support, but that was not forthcoming.
