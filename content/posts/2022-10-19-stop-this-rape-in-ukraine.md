Gruesome rape and torment in Ukraine  
Causing women and children agonising pain.  
Horrific headlines curdles one to the bone.  
Russian soldiers have no hearts of their own.  
Can't they leave the innocent alone?  
Women like prisoners tied to a chain,  
Gory details of Women and babies raped  
There's no escape.  
Only pain.  
Bodies of women and children everywhere.  
Rape is a weapon of war.  
The innocent have no sword or spear.  
Only the bloody scar.  
Soldiers strangle them with hatred,  
Is this why you were created?  
Innocent lives are wasted.  
There's nothing sacred.  
How can this evil be tolerated?
