Alfred Charles Sharpton


_“But you don’t fight crime by becoming criminals yourself. You don’t stand up to thugs in the street becoming thugs yourself. You don’t fight gangs by becoming five armed men against an unarmed man. That ain’t the police. That’s punks.”  
_  
**The Rev. Al Sharpton** on February 1 at Tyre Nichols’ funeral, the 29-year-old who died three days after being beaten by Memphis police officers for no apparent reason last month.

“It was a year of endurance, a year of compassion, a year of bravery, a year of pain, a year of hope, a year of perseverance, a year of unity, a year of invincibility, a fierce year of invincibility. Its main conclusion is that we have survived. We have not been defeated.”

**President Volodymyr Zelensky,** marking the first anniversary of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

“The Russian invasion of the Ukraine has triggered the most massive violations of human rights we are living today. It has unleashed widespread deaths, destruction and displacement. Attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure have caused many casualties and terrible suffering.”

**Secretary-General António Guterres** at an event to commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on February 27.
